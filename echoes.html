Echoes of exodus

</p>

<p>


The exodus is central to the Scriptures, central to the gospel, and
central to the Christian life. Whatever book of the Bible you are 
reading, and whichever Christian practices you are involved in, 
echoes of the exodus are in there somewhere.
This is not the kind of thing you can establish through logical 
argument: A, therefore B, therefore C. Stories don’t usually work 
that way. You can’t prove logically that West Side Story is based 
on Romeo and Juliet. The echoes cannot be proved, any more than 
you can prove that a joke is funny. Rather, they have to be heard.
Our approach in this book starts from there. We hope to 
convince you that Scripture contains all sorts of connections, 
riffs, and themes that you may not have noticed, but we hope 
to do this by showing rather than by telling. Sometimes you 
may disagree. You may think we’re reaching, or you may think 
we’ve missed something. In many ways, that doesn’t matter. As 
long as we recognize that The Lion King is based on Hamlet, 
we can agree to disagree on whether Nala is an anti-Ophelia, or 
whether we can see Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in the characters of Pumbaa and Timon.
Prelude

Having said that, we will generally err on the side of hearing 
those echoes more, rather than less.1
 Partly this is because we 
think those connections are actually there, both in the events 
themselves, through the providence of God, and in the ways 
the biblical writers have told their stories. Partly, though, it is 
because we can see a number of ways in which a greater appreciation of the unity of Scripture, especially when it comes 
to the theme of redemption from slavery, can help strengthen 
the church in the twenty-first century. Four ways in particular 
spring to mind.
One: much of the contemporary church, especially in evangelical circles, suffers from a rootlessness that makes it easy to 
lose our bearings, and even our identity. We live in a disoriented 
and rootless age.2
 Novelty and self-expression are prized above 
wisdom and experience. Inevitably, this has affected the church, 
not just in its forms of worship, but in its very sense of identity. 
In this sort of world, there is no better way of finding our moorings than reading the Old Testament (in particular) as if it were, 
as Paul puts it, “written for our sake” (1 Cor. 9:10; see also 
Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11).We view the Scriptures, and the exodus in particular, as not just their story, but as ours. “Our fathers 
were all under the cloud,” Paul tells the Corinthians (1 Cor. 
10:1). They all passed through the sea. They all ate spiritual 
food and drank spiritual drink. And these things happened as 
examples for us, their great-great-etc.-grandchildren (vv. 1–6). 
We are to read about the exodus like we might read about the 
D-day landings: as a defining history that explains who we are. 
The exodus is our family story.
Two: the more we see the connections between the Testaments, the less likely we are to succumb to the idea that the 
God of the Old Testament is morally inferior to or must be 
distinguished from the God revealed in Jesus. Few people will 
explicitly state it like this, but many are eager to put as much 
distance as possible between, say, the conquest of Canaan and 
Prelude
15
the person of Jesus, as if the latter could never have approved 
of, let alone commanded, the former. Others have gone further 
and argued that God simply never kills anybody for any reason, 
so every instance of violence in the Bible that implicates God 
should be seen as (a) incompatible with Jesus, and therefore 
(b) invented by ancient Israel.3
 Seeing the extent to which the 
exodus story is echoed throughout Scripture, not least in the 
ministry and teaching of Jesus, exposes the fragile foundations 
of all kinds of neo-Marcionism.4
Three: our generation is confused as to the nature of true 
freedom. No matter how often we experience liberation from 
constraints, limitations, and oppression, we still find ourselves 
falling into new forms of bondage. We get free from boredom, 
and fall into slavery to distraction. We pursue liberty from prohibitions, and fall into bondage to addictions. We escape repression, and become enslaved to lust. We are released from 
isolation, and fall captive to peer pressure and the power of the 
online mob. We pursue liberty from the constraints upon our 
natures, and fall into bondage to our untrained passions. We 
successfully break out of 1984, only to find ourselves in Brave 
New World. Or, in the imagery of The Hunger Games, we get 
free from fences and guns in the districts, only to find ourselves 
trapped by slavish banality in the Capitol. True freedom is more 
complicated than it looks.
So, for example, the twenty-first-century church in the West 
faces two pressing ethical challenges that would seem to pull it 
in opposite directions. The first is the need for racial reconciliation and justice, which in the wider culture is generally seen as a 
progressive cause; the second is the need to remain orthodox on 
sexual ethics, which is typically a conservative concern. When 
framed in a secular way, these aims look to stand in tension: 
either you denounce your past prejudices and pursue radical 
inclusion for everyone, maximizing freedom by removing all 
constraints and limitations, or you stand firm in the face of 
Prelude
16
cultural pressure and preserve the traditions of your fathers, restricting people’s freedom for some higher cause. When framed 
by the exodus story, however, these categories disintegrate. Our 
redemption story is one in which “freedom from” is inextricably 
bound up with “freedom to.” God’s people are exodus people, 
so we know both the pain of oppression on racial grounds in 
Egypt, and the dangers of compromise, idolatry, and immorality 
in the wilderness. We also know that there is little point in being 
free from serving Pharaoh if we are not also free to serve the 
Lord. So we are not defined by the categories of 1789 or 1968, 
by progressive and conservative, left and right. We pursue true 
freedom—whether from Egypt or the golden calf, oppression or 
immorality—knowing that if the Son sets us free, we will be free 
indeed (John 8:36).
Four: for a variety of reasons, different sections of the church 
today have become aligned with particular images, models, or 
pictures of the atonement, leading to a shrinking of the biblical 
gospel, as well as a fair bit of disunity and suspicion. (Some say 
“I am of Christus Victor,” some say “I am of reconciliation,” 
some say “I am of penal substitution,” and others say, “I am of 
Christ.”) Reactions have bred counterreactions, and the center 
of our faith has, somewhat tragically, become a source of contention.5
 The exodus story, however, because it is so long and 
recurs so often, provides a wonderful framework for thinking 
about how all the different atonement imagery fits together. It is 
a story of redemption from slavery, involving blood sacrifice, a 
substitute, liberation, reconciliation with God, a great victory, 
vindication through faith, union with God, adoption, priesthood, Passover, baptism, kingdom, and probably others—all 
of which, of course, also take place through the cross—and as 
such, the exodus story helps us grasp how these many descriptions of what Christ has done for us can all be true, without 
needing them to be played off against each other.
All of this is to say: we reap all sorts of benefits when we see 
Prelude
17
the unity of Scripture, particularly when it comes to the exodus.6
Nevertheless, most of this book is not about any of those things. 
In the main, it is a book about the exodus theme in the Bible, 
written to help people make more sense of Scripture, more sense 
of the gospel, and more sense of the Christian life. Our hope is 
that it will help fuel your prayers, your worship, and your joy, 
and that in seeing the exodus in a new light, you will see the God 
of the exodus in a new light as well.

A Musical Reading 
of Scripture
Scripture is music.
We use musical metaphors all the time when we talk about 
the Scriptures, without even thinking about it. We might describe the Bible as a symphony or a love song. We might refer 
to the opening of Genesis as an overture or to Revelation as a 
finale. We might talk about the story being composed or perhaps 
orchestrated by God, with themes and rhythms and echoes running through it, all building to a crescendo. If we are handling 
some of the difficult sections, we might say that there is a clash
here or a discordant note there, but that there is always, ultimately, a harmony within the Word of God, and therefore that 
we can expect things to resolve. We could describe John as written in a different key than the other three Gospels, or Chronicles 
as a transposed version of Kings. We might even identify specific 
books with particular musical modes or styles: Job is the blues, 
Ecclesiastes is jazz, some of the psalms are in the minor key, or 
whatever. Much of our language for Scripture is musical.
Overture
22
That might sound trivial. After all, we use figures of speech 
all the time, and don’t necessarily intend for them to be taken 
that seriously. But the reality is that metaphors, particularly ones 
that are applied consistently in a particular context, exercise a 
powerful influence over the way we conceptualize things, and 
this influence can be helpful, damaging, or neither. It’s worth 
thinking about that for a moment.
To start with a fairly neutral example: we tend to understand 
people’s theories and arguments in terms of buildings. This idea 
is foundational to my understanding. I demolished his case by 
destabilizing his assumptions. I built my argument and supported it with further examples. I constructed a defense for the 
position; the structural weakness of her theory can be seen at 
this point; their position was shaky; my view was robust; his 
argument collapsed under cross-examination. This controlling 
image isn’t particularly harmful, and it isn’t particularly illuminating, but it constrains our thinking more than we realize (as 
evidenced by the fact that all of us do it, and very few of us even 
notice). Metaphors matter.
Consider a different example, where the influence of the controlling metaphor might be more of a problem. Politicians use 
the language of war in all sorts of nonliteral settings. We have 
wars on terror, on poverty, on drugs, on obesity, on waste, and 
apparently on an ever-increasing number of abstract nouns. We 
must fight this, we are going to defeat that, the real battlefield
is here, and so on. The war metaphor is familiar, and so it manages to relieve some of the sense of fear and discomfort we are 
experiencing (this menace is out there, and it is a genuine threat, 
but don’t worry everyone, we will conquer this enemy). It also 
focuses the mind, implying an immediate and serious threat to 
our well-being as a society, and therefore the need to make the 
matter in question a top priority, even if it demands costly commitment and sacrifices. At the same time, the concept of war 
encourages us to think in very binary terms—good guys and bad 
A Musical Reading of Scripture
23
guys, heroes and villains, enemies to be defeated and territory to 
be defended—which, when oversimplifying complex problems, 
has backfired in various ways in the war on terror and the war 
on drugs. It raises the rhetorical stakes and rallies people to a 
cause, but turns everyone into opponents or allies, when many 
are neither, or perhaps even both (a point which is made powerfully in movies like Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic and Peter Berg’s 
The Kingdom).
But now imagine that instead of employing military metaphors when speaking about a problem like, say, poverty, we employed a fabric metaphor instead. Say we talked about the frayed 
edges of society and recovering the stitches we once dropped. 
Say we lamented the unraveling of communities, addressed the 
knotty tangles of social problems, and argued that belonging to 
close-knit families was a crucial thread in the fabric of society. 
That metaphor might cause us to think and act rather differently. It would subtly teach us to think of our problems less in 
terms of opposition to an external enemy and more in terms of 
our interconnectedness and the importance of maintaining the 
integrity of society’s relationships. It would alert us to the delicate character of social problems and of the need for patience, 
care, and measured action in addressing them, lest tangles become knots by being pulled too hard, or dropped stitches lead to 
unraveling by being ignored for too long. On the face of it, the 
only change would be our choice of metaphor—but the implications could be substantial.
The point is this: metaphors have great power to fashion the 
way we conceptualize things, even when we don’t notice they 
are doing it. If a controlling metaphor is chosen well, it has the 
capacity to illuminate new worlds of meaning and help us see all 
sorts of connections we might otherwise have missed.
So it is with Scripture and music.
• • • •
Overture
24
A musical approach to Scripture encompasses a number of 
aspects, each of which can help us see Scripture in a fresh light. 
One, which we have already mentioned, involves the language 
of tension and resolution. Sometimes two or more books of 
the Bible, or even two or more parts of the same book, seem to 
clash with each other, and no resolution is obvious. Yet as the 
biblical piece develops, we find new themes being introduced, 
which bring the various instruments together, rearrange things 
somewhat, and resolve with a harmony that does justice to all 
of them. Sometimes the clashes are sustained and deliberate and 
uncomfortable to listen to, but they point forward to a future 
moment when things will be brought back together again by 
the master Composer. Scripture, in that sense, is true like jazz.
Another aspect of the music metaphor is the relationship 
between melody and harmony. The Bible has a clear storyline, 
a melody, a tune, and it can be summarized (or sung) by a small 
child. It also has a range of individual and corporate stories 
that run together, sometimes taking center stage, sometimes 
fading into the background, providing harmony and counterpoint, treble and bass, height and depth, in such a way that no 
single writer (or musician) could possibly represent it all. Like 
Beethoven’s famous “Ode to Joy,” the Bible is both memorably 
simple, even catchy, and incredibly intricate at the same time. 
Biblical study is about exploring the detail of the harmony—
Why is the oboe, or Obadiah, doing that, and how does it contribute to the whole piece?—without losing sight of the melody. 
Biblical meditation is about listening to the music for enjoyment, 
not mere interest, to the point where we dance to its rhythms, 
sing its choruses, and whistle its melodies on the bus into work.
A third (and more subtle) aspect is the interplay between 
rhythm and meter. Meter is the underlying time structure of a 
piece, whether it is audible or not—one, two, three, four, one, 
two, three, four—and although it may vary within the piece, 
it provides a grounding in time, a sense of orientation, for 
A Musical Reading of Scripture
25
the listener. Rhythm is the structure of the sound you actually 
hear—boom, ba-cha, boom, boom, ba-cha—which may involve 
a number of notes in one beat, or a number of beats without 
notes. The rhythm rides the meter like a surfer rides a wave, 
playing, doing its own thing, but always mindful of and constrained by the steady movement underneath.
Scripture works in a similar way. Chronologically speaking, every day is as long as every other day, with the passing of 
weeks, months, seasons, and years providing a meter for the 
piece as it unfolds. If we want to, we can form timelines from the 
Bible, reconstruct histories, and synchronize dates with external 
sources. But the rhythm of Scripture is not like that. Strong, accented, audible beats dominate the rhythm—Sabbath, Passover, 
the Day of Atonement, Pentecost, and the like—and they form 
regular patterns that draw repeated attention to particularly 
important moments in the story. And because the rhythm is 
repeated so much, every time we hear it, we are somehow transported back to the first time we heard it and forward to the next. 
So when Mary approaches the tomb early in the morning of the 
first day of the week, while it is still dark, we are swept back to 
the first day of the very first week, while it was still dark, and we 
anticipate the Word of God shattering the darkness: “Let there 
be light!” From then on, as the first day of the week becomes 
the Lord’s Day, we look back to creation and back to Easter, and 
simultaneously look forward to the day when all darkness will 
become light, and death will be finally swallowed up in victory. 
Metrically speaking, all beats are equal. Rhythmically speaking, 
some beats are more equal than others.
When we bring these three aspects together—tension and 
resolution, melody and harmony, rhythm and meter—we get a 
full, rich picture of the connections between the different parts 
of Scripture. As the Bible commences with its overture, we hear a 
melody, and a regular rhythm begins. As things develop, various 
harmonies and counterpoints arise, some of which complement 
Overture
26
the melody beautifully, but some of which chafe against it, leaving us listeners to wonder what the Composer is doing. (Often, 
of course, we cause the dissonance, and he is simply waiting 
for the right time to heal it.) Then the melody returns, cutting 
through the cacophony and bringing a temporary sense of resolution. To someone who has never heard the piece before, it 
could even sound like it has been fully resolved and is about to 
finish (a new reader of the Bible could easily think the tension 
is resolved, for instance, upon the entrance into the Promised 
Land or David’s coronation). Yet these temporary resolutions 
produce tensions of their own, which point forward to more 
complexities, and beyond them, to further resolutions. Throughout the Bible, as time metronomically marches on, the rhythms 
of Scripture continue to be accented, with particular days and 
festivals highlighting rest and freedom, law and atonement. But 
every bar, every cadence, every pause, heightens the sense that 
the piece is still incomplete. Eventually, after an uncomfortably 
long silence, the score builds to a massive crescendo in Christ, as 
the various themes come together and resolve in a fashion that 
nobody could have imagined, bringing the audience to its feet. 
Yet even then, the piece does not end but continues to develop 
themes and ideas, progressing toward a conclusion, echoing the 
original melody throughout, and retaining (while modifying) the 
original rhythms. Only at the finale, when the Christ-crescendo 
is recapitulated and the instruments are joined by earthly and 
angelic choirs, do we ultimately see the full scope of the Composer’s vision.
As such, a musical reading of Scripture does more justice to 
the way Scripture actually works than, say, a pictorial reading, 
or even a dramatic reading. Plays are linear: this happens, then 
that happens, and although the past obviously shapes the present and future, it never comes back. Pictures are representative: 
this is a picture, an image, a copy, a shadow, a silhouette of 
that. Scriptural typology is more like a piece of music: familiar 
A Musical Reading of Scripture
27
themes like temple, kingdom, exodus, judgment, and sacrifice 
keep recurring, but always slightly differently. The judgment of 
Jerusalem is not just a “picture” or “shadow” of the last day; 
nor is it simply a dramatic “event” that happens once and then is 
no more. It is somehow a part of the future judgment, a foretaste 
of it, and yet at the same time historically distinct from it. The 
final resolution, when it comes, is both familiar and new at the 
same time. It is, in that sense, musical.
• • • •
This all sounds a bit floaty and a bit abstract. In many ways, it 
is. In fact, it’s the sort of approach to Scripture that is far easier 
to see than to imagine, and far more useful to show than to 
describe. We need to see this approach in action to fully get our 
heads around it. So that’s what the rest of this book is going 
to try to do, using perhaps the clearest example of a recurring, 
time-condensing, rhythmic, melodic theme in the entire Bible—
one that illuminates the opening pages of Genesis and the closing pages of Revelation, the whole history of Israel, the Gospels, 
the Letters, the Christian life, and of course the death and resurrection of Jesus.
The exodus.

The First Supper
Matthew 26
Meals can transcend time. Taste, and particularly smell, can 
evoke intense memories and take us immediately back to the 
last time we experienced the same flavor or aroma. Ritual meals, 
celebrated the same way with the same food, drink, and format 
every year, can connect the decades together in ways that nothing else does—so an American family celebrating Thanksgiving 
in 2017 is closer, in many ways, to Thanksgiving 1917 than it is 
to the previous Tuesday.1 If we are looking to earth the “musical” nature of history in experienced reality, with the themes and 
echoes of previous movements heard afresh in the present, then 
meals are probably our best option.
God knows this. He created us this way. So on the night he 
rescued his people from Egypt, forming the identity of a nation that would last for thirty centuries and counting, he did it 
through a meal. According to Exodus 12–13, in fact, he spent a 
The First Supper
29
significant portion of that crucial day telling the people of Israel 
not just what to do, but how to memorialize it: what to eat, 
when to eat it, and what to say when their children asked about 
it. The story of the Passover, for all its drama, is told in a curiously liturgical way. From its inception, its music was intended 
to be performed, and heard, for thousands of years.
And it has been. Even today, the Passover seder is celebrated all 
over the world, with the same story being told, the same matzot 
(unleavened breads) and bitter herbs being eaten, the same cup of 
wine in the center of the table, the same songs being sung at each 
table. The constant, consistent repetition of this musical meal, despite exile and dispersion, pogrom and Holocaust, is at the heart 
of Judaism. And that makes it all the more remarkable that on a 
Thursday evening in Jerusalem, forty years before the destruction 
of the second temple, the most famous Jew of all summons the orchestra, brings the music to a crescendo, and rearranges the melody.
“Take this,” he says, tearing the matzo into pieces and passing it around the table. “This is my body, which is given for you. 
Do this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:17, 19). This alone 
is astonishing. Jesus is specifically identifying the unleavened 
bread as representing his body, which goes beyond the purity 
and unleavenedness of Israel, and he is telling his Jewish followers to celebrate the Passover in memory of him, not just their 
liberation from slavery in Egypt. After they have eaten, he takes 
the wine cup and goes one better. “Drink of it, all of you, for 
this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many 
for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I will not drink again of 
this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you 
in my Father’s kingdom” (Matt. 26:27–29). This is not just a 
new understanding of Passover; it is a new covenant altogether. 
The kingdom of the Father is nearly here. Jesus’s blood is going 
to move Israel’s history from one phase to another. Sins are 
going to be forgiven and remembered no more, as the prophet 
Jeremiah said. The great deliverance is coming.
Overture
30
By saying these things in the context of a Passover meal, and 
by giving the events of the next twenty-four hours a memorializing, liturgical shape—just as the Lord had through Moses—Jesus 
is doing more than creating an analogy. He is not just saying that 
his death for them is a bit like the death of the Passover lamb for 
Israel, or that their liberation from sin is a bit like their liberation from Egypt. In taking these familiar symbols and investing 
them with new content, combining continuity and discontinuity, 
he is accenting the story of Passover in a different way and adding meaning to it that nobody had previously seen. It is not just 
that the Last Supper evokes the Passover in hindsight; it is that the 
Passover evokes the Last Supper in advance. Jesus’s broken body 
and spilled blood, in some mysterious way, is bound up with the 
fact that Israel ate matzot and drank wine in the first place. The 
deliverance from slavery to Pharaoh was always going to be fulfilled in the deliverance from slavery to sin. The Mosaic covenant 
builds toward the new covenant. Passover culminates in Eucharist.
Within this Passover-shaped framework, with its rich array 
of images, the meaning of Christ’s death comes into sharp focus. 
Passover is, if you like, the crucial clue that helps us decipher a 
much larger puzzle. Jesus is the firstborn Son, who dies in the 
climactic divine judgment under a darkened sky, opening up the 
doors of God’s house. Jesus is the Passover Lamb, whose bones 
are preserved from being broken and whose blood proclaims 
freedom rather than condemnation. Jesus is the angel of the 
Lord who goes before us, forging a path through the deep, so 
that we might pass through on dry land. Jesus is the one who 
outwits and overcomes the great dragon in an almighty showdown, drowning Death in death at the very point when our 
Enemy presumes he has triumphed. Jesus is the Shepherd like 
Moses, who is struck but leads his people out. Jesus is the one 
who establishes a new covenant in his blood, sealed in a covenant meal that alludes to the covenant meal of Sinai (Ex. 24:11), 
and invites everyone to join him. Jesus is the pure, unleavened 
The First Supper
31
Bread of Life, the Lord of the wine which symbolizes new creation, the one who eats the herbs of bitterness with us, and the 
one who explains to his descendants what all these symbols 
mean.
Yet even as he does all these things and is all these things, 
he is still pointing forward to the eschatological celebration to 
come. “I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine 
until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom” (Matt. 26:29). The fact that Passover is fulfilled does not 
mean that it is finished. The Last Supper, like the First Supper, celebrates God’s deliverance without regarding the story as 
complete, fanning the flames of hope as well as gratitude. One 
day, Jesus says, there will be new wine, a new kingdom, a new 
creation, and a new deliverance, and I will be with you forever. 
That day, as well as this one, is what you are looking to as long 
as you take the bread and drink the wine. But until it comes, do 
this in remembrance of me.
Review Questions
1. How can meals work musically?
2. Name three ways in which the Passover can illuminate the 
meaning of the death and resurrection of Christ.
3. What are some of the ways that the Last Supper looks forward 
to the future?
Thought Questions
1. Why might Jesus have chosen a meal as a primary framework 
for presenting the meaning of his death?
2. In Luke 22:16, Jesus declares that he “will not eat [the Passover] 
until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” How does the kingdom of God fulfill the Passover?
3. John’s Gospel account does not mention the institution of 
the Lord’s Supper. What are some of the other ways Passover 
themes are present in John’s account?

From the Bulrushes 
to the Bush
Exodus 1–3
Long before Moses led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, he 
experienced two exoduses of his own. We often read these opening chapters so quickly, treating them as a glorified prologue to 
the blood-and-thunder, Prince-of-Egypt drama we know and 
love, that we miss this part of the story altogether (and this 
means we often miss the crucial role women play in the exodus 
story). But it’s right there in the text. Moses has an exodus journey at birth, he has another at age forty, then he leads Israel in a 
third at age eighty, and then he dies at one hundred and twenty, 
right after seeing the land to which his whole life had been pointing. Quite a track record.
The first exodus comes in the midst of a plot that should be 
familiar to anyone who has read the garden story in Genesis. 
The people of Israel are fruitful and multiply and fill the land, 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
36
but the serpent-like king is tricksy, and he attacks the women, 
with a view to destroying their male descendants. Yet in contrast to the garden story, the women outmaneuver him. First 
the midwives, then Moses’s mother, and finally his older sister, 
Miriam, use their wisdom to beat the serpent at his own game, 
and preserve the seed of the woman. In fact, until Moses grows 
up, the only man who really features in the story is the dragonlike Pharaoh, hell-bent on destroying God’s people.
It works like this. Moses’s mother, Jochebed, knows there 
is something special about her baby boy, so she constructs an 
“ark,” or basket, for him just as Noah had done (Exodus 2 is 
the only place in Scripture outside the flood story in which this 
word for “ark” appears). She covers it with pitch, just as Noah 
had done. While Pharaoh is building cities, an Israelite woman 
is building a tiny, unimpressive little ark for a child to be thrown 
into the water. Yet this ark, like Noah’s, will become the vehicle 
through which God rescues the righteous from watery destruction, foils the plans of the wicked, and creates a new nation in 
the midst of the old.
Pharaoh’s daughter hears the cry of the baby and takes 
pity on him, just as the Lord will hear the cry of Israel in 
slavery and take pity on them. Moses’s basket is taken from 
amongst the reeds, just as Israel will be rescued through the Sea 
of Reeds. Moses is drawn out of the water even as others are 
drowned, just as Israel will later be, and it becomes a defining 
feature of his identity (the name “Mosheh” means “he draws 
out”), just as it will be for Israel. Miriam is the key witness 
to the event, just as she will be at the Red Sea. With his adoption by Pharaoh’s daughter, Moses’s exodus instantly transfers 
him from oppression into royalty, just as Israel’s exodus will 
instantly turn them from oppressed slaves into royal priests. As 
Moses becomes part of an Egyptian family, we even get a hint 
of how Egyptians and Israelites will be joined together into 
one mixed multitude of covenant people, replete with Egyptian

riches (Ex. 12:35–38). This is not the last time that Mosheh 
will be “drawn out.”
Forty years pass. Israel’s slavery continues. One day, Moses, 
stirred to action by the injustice of it, kills an Egyptian who is 
beating a fellow Israelite, and must flee from Pharaoh to the east 
and spend forty years in the wilderness. This part of the story is 
frequently used as an example of what not to do (“Moses tried 
to do God’s work but ignored God’s timing,” or some such), but 
the narrator never suggests that application. In fact, the parallels 
with Moses’s third and most dramatic exodus—in which Moses 
will be stirred to action, the suffering of the Hebrews will be 
noticed and then relieved, Egyptians will be killed, and Moses 
will flee Pharaoh to the east before spending forty years in the 
wilderness—suggest that Moses is foreshadowing Israel’s later 
rescue, not bungling it.
His exodus takes him into the land of Midian, where his first 
recorded action is to fight off shepherds at a well and provide 
water for seven women and their flock. For all the sermons 
you hear on how David’s time as a shepherd prepared him for 
national leadership (“your servant has struck down both lions 
and bears” [1 Sam. 17:36]), it is rare to hear one on the same 
pattern here, but notice: Moses will later defend the innocent 
against a false shepherd, using his own shepherd’s staff, and 
then provide water in the wilderness for an entire nation. One 
of these women, Zipporah, becomes his wife, and he names their 
son Gershom (gêr means “sojourner”), saying, “I have been a 
sojourner in a foreign land” (Ex. 2:22). He speaks here not just 
for himself, but for the whole of Israel.
The climax of this second exodus story is the meeting with 
God on the mountain, in the burning bush. The similarities between this encounter and the subsequent encounter on Mount 
Sinai (which is also known as Mount Horeb) are remarkable:
both involve an invitation to approach mingled with a warning not to come too close, both are accompanied by fire, both 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
38
cause people to hide their faces, both are accompanied by miraculous signs, both summon Moses and Israel to respond in 
obedience, and both take place on the same mountain. But for 
all these similarities it is the revelation of the divine name, “I
am who I am” (Exodus 3) or “The Lord, the Lord, a God 
merciful and gracious” (Ex. 34:6), that serves as the high point 
in each story. Key moments of rescue in Scripture are often accompanied by the revelation of God’s name—God Almighty, 
God-Will-Provide, God-Is-My-Banner, the Rock, Immanuel, 
and so on—but these two revelations, both of which come toward the end of an exodus narrative, are the two to which the 
Scriptures most frequently return. Only by knowing God as 
the unchangeable, incomparable, eternal, self-existent, merciful, 
gracious, and compassionate God that he revealed himself to be 
on Mount Horeb can Moses, or Israel, or anyone who follows 
him today, have any hope of approaching, obeying, or worshiping him. “Whom shall I say has sent me?” we ask. “I am,” he 
says simply. So get on with it.
Finally, we come to one of the most puzzling stories in the 
whole Bible: the time when the Lord tried to kill Moses (Ex. 
4:24–26). As odd as this story is when read out of context 
(which, owing to its strangeness, it often is), it is probably yet 
another example of what we have been seeing in this chapter, 
namely that Moses lives out the exodus story at least twice before he leads Israel out of Egypt. That is, we have in this short 
and rather painful story a foreshadowing, a musical prelude, of 
the Passover.
Look at it this way: It is night. Moses has just been told 
to warn Pharaoh that his firstborn son may be killed, because 
Israel is God’s firstborn son. But Moses’s own son has not been 
circumcised, which is the nonnegotiable mark of divine sonship for Israel. Moses has neglected God’s commandment and 
now stands outside the mark of sonship, under the same judgment as Pharaoh. So, not for the first time, a woman comes to 
From the Bulrushes to the Bush
39
Moses’s rescue: Zipporah circumcises their son and puts the 
blood on display, “covering” Moses with it so that the Lord 
will not kill him. His son’s foreskin becomes the Passover lamb, 
spread over the beams of his house at nighttime, and Moses is 
saved. You wonder whether one of the reasons Moses stressed 
obeying every detail of God’s instructions on the first Passover 
(Exodus 12) was that, in this incident, he had seen something of 
what happens when you don’t.
So Moses experiences an exodus at birth and another at age 
forty, complete with rescue by blood and through water (which 
may remind you of other places where salvation is accompanied 
by blood and water). By the time he reaches his third exodus, at 
age eighty, he might have a sense of déjà vu, or even be thinking, 
Oh no, not again. But God has fashioned Moses, quietly and 
secretly, into an exodus-shaped person. He has built toward the 
primary exodus with a series of smaller deliverances that gradually increased in intensity, like teaser trailers building toward the 
release of a movie. He has given the life of Moses and the life of 
Israel the same pattern, as Paul will later point out when he says 
that Israel was “baptized into Moses” (1 Cor. 10:2). God has 
demonstrated his sovereign control of history, building Moses’s 
confidence for the future. Given the stakes, Moses will need 
every bit of faith in God’s power to rescue, and every fragment 
of trust in the God who “draws out,” that he can possibly lay 
hold of. So God’s preparation, as lengthy and largely unnoticed 
as it is, is all vital groundwork. It always is.
Finally, with two exoduses already under his belt, Moses 
heads off to see Pharaoh. The stage is set for a showdown.

The Battle of the Gods
Exodus 4–15
The exodus is a battle of the gods, in which only one can emerge 
from the ring victorious. At the human level, all of the musical 
themes we are considering in this book—oppression, plagues, 
blood, redemption, escape, presence, water, victory, celebration, 
wilderness, inheritance—are here. But behind them all stands 
the conflict between the deities: Egypt’s against Israel’s, the false 
against the true, the serpent against the seed, Pharaoh against 
the Lord. It is a mismatch. Battles against the Lord always are.
We get a sense of this before the confrontation with Pharaoh 
even begins. Moses, you will remember, is worried that the Israelites will not believe him, so God gives him three signs, each of 
which point forward to the war to come (Ex. 4:1–9). First, God 
tells him to throw his staff onto the ground, and it becomes a 
serpent. Moses is scared, but when he takes hold of the serpent 
by the tail, it hardens back into a staff. Pharaoh, the serpent and 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
42
destroyer, may be frightening, but when Moses takes hold of him 
by the tail, he will be hardened and ultimately turn into a rod 
by which God will fulfill his purposes (“I will harden Pharaoh’s 
heart . . . and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, and 
the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord” [14:4]). Second, 
Moses puts his hand into his cloak, and it becomes diseased 
and unclean, and then he puts it back in his cloak again, and it 
emerges restored. God has the power to afflict and corrupt and 
also the power to restore and make alive, and the battle to come 
will see both at work. Third, God tells Moses that if he takes 
water from the Nile and pours it on the ground, it will turn to 
blood. One of Egypt’s gods, and its primary source of livelihood 
and purity, will become a river of death, in a sinister echo of the 
attempt to drown Israel’s boys. The battle lines are drawn.
Pharaoh, as predicted, refuses to let Israel go, and the war 
of the gods begins. The plagues, like many invasions, gradually 
escalate. They build in intensity: the early plagues affect everybody, and can be reproduced by Pharaoh’s magicians, whereas 
the later ones affect only Egypt, and cannot be reproduced. But 
they also escalate in a literal and geographical sense. The first 
group of three plagues strikes the water and the ground, as the 
Nile bleeds, frogs rise up from the water, and the dust turns to 
gnats. The second group strikes living flesh, with swarms of flies, 
the death of livestock, and human skin being covered in boils. 
The third group moves higher, up to the skies, bringing destruction through the weather, bringing locusts on the east wind, and 
even blackening the sun. If the ancient world were a three-story 
house—the earth, the waters beneath, and the heavens above—
God brought destruction to each story and humiliated the deities that “governed” each. The Egyptian gods were ferreted out 
and removed from the house, like a pest or an infestation, from 
cellar to rafter.
Finally, and climactically, Moses pronounces the tenth 
plague: the death of the firstborn son. We can try to soften the 
The Battle of the Gods
43
horror of this by pointing out important contextual factors—the 
repeated warnings, the way the deaths of Egyptian sons echo 
the deaths of Israelite sons earlier, the fact that firstborn sons 
represented the strength and future destiny of the ancient family, 
the oppression of Israel as God’s firstborn son, the larger narrative in which Israelite freedom will lead to Egyptian salvation, 
the ongoing war between the seed of the serpent and the seed of 
the woman, and so on—but many of us will still find the story 
deeply troubling. This book does not attempt a defense of God’s 
right to kill people, and Scripture doesn’t either. But it is worth 
noting that, for all our questions and concerns, the narrative 
doesn’t dwell on what happens to Egypt, giving it only two 
verses (Ex. 12:29–30). It is far more interested with the institution of the Passover.
Shelves could be filled with books on the significance of Passover, and probably have been. In a number of ways, the Passover 
is an obvious prelude to the work of Christ. It is about redemption from slavery by the blood of a lamb. It is about a sacrifice 
that passes through the fire and saves people from death, when 
everyone around them is facing judgment. It is about the power 
of faith worked out through obedience. Israelite families were 
not saved by their personal godliness that night or even by the 
amount of confidence they had in God They were saved simply 
by the fact that the blood was over their house.1
But the Passover also carries a number of less obviously 
“Christian” meanings. It is about purity: a spotless lamb, the 
removal of leaven, a seven-day festival, and hyssop dipped in 
blood are all required. It is about suffering: the bitter herbs remind future Israelites of the way things were before they entered 
a land flowing with milk and honey. It is about unity: entire 
households eat an entire lamb, with none of its bones broken 
and none left over until the morning. It is about the nature of 
memorial: much of the text focuses on the way Israel’s life, liturgy, and worship will be shaped by the Passover celebration in 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
44
the future. It is about the blessing of the nations: a “mixed multitude” is joined to Israel (12:38) and allowed to share Passover 
as long as they are circumcised. It is about childbirth: as Egypt 
becomes a tomb, covered in darkness and ash, Israel steps out 
from the womb through doorposts covered in blood, sets apart 
the firstborn sons, and later emerges into new life from a narrow 
passage through waters, which then close again behind them.
And so, in the middle of the night and without even a dog 
growling at them (Ex. 11:7), Israel begins the great escape. They 
are accompanied by untold numbers of Egyptians (representing 
God’s global blessing), huge material wealth (his abundance), 
Joseph’s bones (his faithfulness to his promises), and a pillar of 
cloud and a pillar of fire (his presence), as they flee the land of 
oppression. One more obstacle remains, however. Before Israel 
is to be truly free, they have to pass through the waters.
The boundary-marking power of water must be one of the 
hardest aspects of the exodus story for modern people to grasp, 
in our world of bridges and tunnels, ferries and airplanes. (Remarkably, there is not a single reference to bridges in the entire 
Bible.) In the biblical landscape, waters divide. The waters above 
are divided from the waters below, so if you want to descend to 
the depths or ascend to the heavens, you have to pass through 
water. The waters are divided from the dry land. The lands are 
divided by the great rivers, which makes a river crossing more 
like entering another country than driving across a bridge. Water 
even divides time as well as space, separating one era from the 
next: Noah passes through the flood into a new world; Jacob 
fords the Jabbok into a new name; Joshua crosses the Jordan 
into a new land; and John baptizes people into a new kingdom. 
Only when Jesus comes and pours out living water do we find 
the world’s divisions finally disappearing—Jew and Greek, male 
and female, slave and free (Gal. 3:28)—in the waters of baptism.
As Moses raises his staff, and with the Egyptian army in pursuit, God divides the waters. This is true physically, in that dry 
The Battle of the Gods
45
land genuinely appears between two bodies of water, as it did on 
the third day of creation. But God also uses the waters to divide 
one nation from another, separating the Israelites from the Egyptians, with the former brought safely onto dry land and the latter brought down to the depths. As the cloud of God’s presence 
comes between the armies (Ex. 14:19–20), it is as if the sky has 
come down and landed above Egypt and beneath Israel, taking 
Israel up into a new, heavenly space. Israel crosses at night but 
walks in the light of God’s cloud into freedom; Egypt crosses as 
the day dawns but is thrown into a panic and covered by watery 
darkness. The night of slavery is over. Morning has broken.
And most importantly, the battle of the gods has been won. 
We might find it surprising, but this is what Israel sings about: 
not freedom, hope, or redemption, but the Lord’s victory over 
Pharaoh, his armies, and his gods. Israel’s God, riding his thronechariot of cloud and fire, has crushed the dragon and hurled him 
into the depths. “The Lord is my strength and my song. . . . 
The Lord is a man of war; . . . Pharaoh’s chariots and his host 
he cast into the sea. . . . Who is like you, O Lord, among the 
gods?” (Ex. 15:2–4, 11). Children’s Bibles and Disney movies 
are filled with the miraculous drama of Israel’s rescue, but the 
mouths of God’s people are filled with the victory of God.
Not for the last time.

True Freedom
Exodus–Deuteronomy
Escaping from Egypt is only the first half of the exodus. It is easy 
for us to forget this, in an age where freedom is understood as 
merely being freedom from: from oppression, from constraint, 
or whatever. This aspect of liberation, as wonderful as it is, is 
only half the deal. In the Scriptures, more emphasis is placed 
on the freedom for: for worship, for flourishing, for growth in 
obedience and joy and glory. Human beings are not designed 
to be free from all constraint, slaves to nothing but our own 
passions, triumphantly enthroned as our own masters, even our 
own gods. Everybody serves somebody. So the point of the exodus is not just for Israel to find deliverance from serving the old 
master. It is for them to find delight in serving the new one.
This powerful truth is at the heart of Christian discipleship. 
The opening question of the Heidelberg Catechism, one of the 
most beautiful statements of Christian doctrine, asks, “What is 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
48
your only comfort in life and in death?” The answer is profound, 
exodus-shaped, and delightful: “That I am not my own, but 
belong, body and soul, in life and in death, to my faithful Savior 
Jesus Christ.” The freest people in the world are those who are 
owned by someone else. Service is liberty. Obedience is joy.
That was God’s endgame with the exodus all along. Back in 
the burning bush, he described Moses’s mission like this: “When 
you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God 
on this mountain” (Ex. 3:12). You are currently servants to 
Pharaoh, God explained, but when we’re done, you will be servants to me. As it turns out, freedom from serving Pharaoh is the 
easy bit. From beginning to end, it takes only fourteen chapters. 
Freedom to serve God, on the other hand, takes forty years of 
wandering and the next four books.
The second half of the exodus begins with Israel’s journey 
to Sinai, which echoes the burning-bush journey of Moses in 
various ways. Israel, like Moses, finds food and water in the wilderness: the sweetening of the water, the arrival of manna and 
quail, and then water from the rock (Ex. 15:22–17:7). Israel, 
like Moses, fights off enemies at the source of water, triumphing 
through a shepherd’s staff (17:8–16). Then, like Moses, Israel 
meets Jethro, who provides food and friendship (18:1–27), before arriving at Mount Sinai/Horeb, where the people are given 
both a commission and commandments (19–20). They also have 
two divine names revealed to them in the process (God-HealsYou and God-Is-My-Banner), just as Moses did (Yahweh and I
am that I am).
The two halves of the exodus—freedom from serving Pharaoh and freedom to serve God—are summarized brilliantly at 
the start of the first commandment: “I am the Lord your God, 
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of 
slavery. You shall have no other gods before me” (Ex. 20:2–3). 
The shape and nature of this service to the Lord is then filled out 
across the next nine commandments, and to this day, those ten 
True Freedom
49
rules encapsulate the shape of a life lived in liberated obedience. 
When the Ten Commandments are finished, to our surprise, the 
very next law concerns something quite obscure: what happens 
when a slave loves his master and wants to continue serving 
him even after he is entitled to leave (21:1–6). Yet a bit of reflection shows that even this reinforces the wider point about true 
freedom. When slaves, like Israel, love their masters, they will 
choose lifelong service over walking away. And the fact that 
the process for doing this involves blood and a doorpost (21:6) 
cannot help but remind us of the Passover.
Two major events dominate the rest of the book of Exodus, 
and both involve building a place of worship: the golden calf and 
the tabernacle, the false and the true, the problem and the solution. Israel’s worship of the golden calf is a classic fall story, with 
a command broken by the priest left in charge (Adam/Aaron), 
the blame shifted to someone else (Eve/Israel), the exposure of 
shame, a curse involving eating (dust/powder), death, the establishment of sword-wielding guardians (cherubim/Levites), 
and the separation of God from his people. It is the low point 
of Israel’s story so far. Yet Moses, the mediator, intercedes for 
Israel and urges God to continue dwelling among his people. 
The Lord relents, shows Moses his glory, reveals his name, and 
renews the covenant (Ex. 34:1–35), before coming to dwell in 
the tabernacle in glory as the book concludes (40:34). This key 
moment—“and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting 
because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled 
the tabernacle” (40:35)—marks a partial reversal of the fall, 
with a new Adam in a new garden and the dwelling place of 
God established again among humans. It also marks the undoing of Israel’s slavery: instead of being forced to build Pharaoh’s 
cities using bricks without straw, they have been invited to build 
God’s house with the best of their gold and silver. Israel, despite 
their disobedience, has now well and truly left the household 
of Pharaoh and joined the household of God, their new master.
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
50
Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy all, in their own 
ways, elaborate on what the freedom to serve the Lord looks 
like in practice. Leviticus is mostly a book of regulation, set at 
Sinai, and focuses on fellowship with God. Numbers is mostly 
a book of rebellion, set on the wilderness journey, and focuses 
on faith in God. Deuteronomy is mostly a book of reiteration, 
set in the land across the Jordan, and focuses on following God, 
culminating in the glorious promise that one day God will circumcise Israel’s hearts and not just their flesh. As hard as these 
books can be to read in places, their significance in the biblical 
story is massive, as they explain and show what the freedom to 
serve God—which was the whole point of the exodus in the first 
place—does and does not look like.
In Numbers, we also have something of a second exodus. 
Having been camped at Sinai for a year, Israel, including any 
foreigners among them, keeps the Passover (Num. 9:1–14), 
and then, led by the pillars of cloud and fire, moves out on 
their journey. They meet Jethro’s son, and travel for three days 
(10:29–36). They complain to Moses, and Moses laments that 
he is not able to do the job on his own, with the result that his 
leadership load is spread among the elders (11:1–30). God, once 
again, provides quail from the sky (11:31–35), water from the 
rock (20:1–13), and military victory (21:21–35). All of these 
echo the first exodus.
As they did in the first exodus, however, Israel falls. Spies 
steal into the land of Canaan to prepare for an invasion, but 
they bring back a bad report. Moses was on God’s mountain for 
forty days, and Israel builds a golden calf; the spies are in God’s 
land for forty days, and Israel abandons their destiny (Num. 
14:1–12). Once again, Moses intercedes for them. Once again, 
God agrees not to destroy them, although a plague strikes some 
of the witnesses. This is not the last of Israel’s rebellions: the 
leadership attempts a coup (16:1–50), and, worse, the people engage in mass idolatry and sexual immorality at Moab (25:1–18), 
True Freedom
51
which resembles the golden calf incident so closely that we even 
have the same violent outcomes (a plague that brings death and 
a Levite taking up arms to kill idolatrous Israelites). This second 
exodus shows that God has not stopped loving Israel—but it 
also shows that Israel has not stopped loving evil.
The greatest threats to true freedom, it seems, do not come 
from external oppression but from within. Delivering Israel 
from slavery to Pharaoh took only ten plagues; delivering Israel from slavery to self, sin, sex, greed, and idolatry took ten 
commandments and ten separate trials and corresponding judgments (Num. 14:22), and ended up with an entire generation 
dying in the wilderness—and even then, the problems persisted. 
True slavery is captivity of the soul, not just the body. Until a 
nation or a person is freed from that, and free to become what 
they were originally intended to be, their exodus is incomplete.
Cultural critic Neil Postman makes a similar point by comparing the scenarios in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and 
George Orwell’s 1984. Orwell, he explains, imagined a future 
in which our freedom is destroyed by external forces (spies, 
prisons, torture chambers, the state), whereas Huxley imagined 
one in which our freedom is destroyed by enemies within (innate 
desires, egotism, hedonism, leisure)—and Huxley, not Orwell, 
was right.1
 A contemporary parallel emerges in Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games: the fatuous, green-haired, celebrityobsessed crowds in the Capitol are in many ways more captive, 
less free, and more pitiable than the bread-starved vagrants 
in District 12. Their chains are invisible, but they are no less 
enslaved.
Biblical freedom involves both halves of the exodus journey. It means being rescued from both Orwell’s and Huxley’s 
nightmares, the tyranny of the other and the tyranny of the self, 
Egyptian enslaving and Israelite craving. Many people today, 
like citizens of the Capitol and of Huxley’s Brave New World, 
do not see it that way; like the Judeans in John 8, they are 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
52
likely to think they have no particular need of freedom, since 
they have never been enslaved to anyone. But for readers of the 
exodus story, the problem and solution are exactly what Jesus 
told those same Judeans. “Everyone who practices sin is a slave 
to sin. . . . So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed” 
(John 8:34, 36).

Journey’s End
Joshua 1–7
The exodus journey finally reaches its destination as Israel 
crosses the Jordan and enters the Promised Land. Until the conquest of Canaan, it feels like the exodus story is incomplete; we 
know that Israel is supposed to live in houses rather than camps, 
eat milk and honey rather than manna and quail, and ultimately 
worship at a temple rather than a tent. Yet the book of Joshua 
does not merely bring one story to completion. In keeping with 
the musical nature of Scripture, it concludes the exodus movement, while at the same time recapitulating it with all sorts of 
subtle variations, which themselves point forward to the melodies and rhythms that will shape the movements to come.
Even a small child, hearing the story for the first time, notices the similarities between the crossing of the Red Sea and the 
crossing of the Jordan. The two crossings are so similar that, in 
a number of places in Scripture, they are blurred together. “The 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
54
sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back,” says Psalm 114:3. In 
their song of triumph on the banks of the Red Sea, Israel had 
celebrated the inheritance of the Land as if it had already happened: “You brought them in and planted them on the mountain of your own possession” (Ex. 15:17 NRSV). Passages like 
these point to the fact that the journey out and the journey in 
are essentially one; the water crossings bookend the wilderness 
journey as an intermediate period that Israel was never intended 
to remain in. If waters in the ancient world were like national 
borders today, then we could compare the whole journey to 
catching a cross-channel ferry: we cross the UK border at Dover 
and the French one at Calais, but in between them we are at sea, 
neither in one country nor the other, waiting for the journey’s 
end. So the similarities between Israel’s two border crossings are 
highly significant, in that they help us see the exodus journey 
as fundamentally a whole—from Egypt to the Promised Land, 
from England to France—rather than a series of two or more 
separate incidents.
This sense of wholeness, and of completion, is borne out 
by all sorts of little connections between the journey out and 
the journey in. The period of wilderness wandering began with 
sending spies into Canaan, and it ends the same way (Joshua 2). 
Moses’s life was saved as a baby through the trickery of a courageous woman, and the same is true for the Israelite spies saved 
by Rahab. Israel’s first actions after crossing the Jordan are to 
set up a memorial, circumcise the men, and celebrate the Passover (Joshua 4–5), just as Israel did before crossing the Red 
Sea. The manna that God provided after the Red Sea crossing 
stops as soon as they eat the fruits of the land (Josh. 5:12). 
Joshua then meets the commander of the Lord’s army and has 
to remove his sandals (Josh. 5:13–15), just as Moses had when 
he first encountered God. From there, Israel brings destruction 
on Jericho, yet spares those who have a crimson cord hanging 
from their window, just as the Lord’s angel brought destruction 
Journey’s End
55
on Egypt, yet spared those with crimson lamb’s blood smeared 
across their doorpost.
Not only that, but the life of Joshua recapitulates the life of 
Moses. Both are chosen by God, have divine encounters at the 
start of their leadership, stretch out their hands for victory, unite 
the nation with the help of the elders and officials, receive confirmation of God’s presence with them, send spies, deal with rebellious Israelites, build altars, mediate between Israel and God, 
have their old age announced and then specified (120 years for 
Moses, 110 for Joshua), make departing speeches that challenge 
Israel to obedience, and are identified as “the servant of the 
Lord” (Deut. 34:5; Josh. 24:29). These echoes are important—
not only because they confirm that the two stories are parts of 
a divinely orchestrated whole, but also because they introduce 
a theme that will reappear in Scripture, particularly in the New 
Testament. Desert prophets, associated with water, make way 
for land prophets associated with rescue. Moses commissions 
Joshua (“The Lord Saves”). Elijah hands over to Elisha (“God 
Saves”). John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus (“The Lord 
Saves”). You get the idea.
When you compare the Moses and Joshua stories, the most 
obvious twist is that the key events happen in reverse order. The 
journey in starts with spies, then a water crossing and memorial, 
then Passover and circumcision, then destruction; the journey 
out began with destruction, then Passover and circumcision, then 
water crossing and memorial, then spies. But the Joshua story 
has other twists and variations too, which do not merely echo or 
complete the original exodus, but subtly change it in ways that 
will become significant as Israel’s story develops. The object that 
causes the waters to stop flowing is not the staff of a prophet, 
but the ark of the Lord. As Israel crosses the water, God’s presence is not behind them, but ahead of them. The woman whose 
trickery saves Israelite lives is a Gentile prostitute, rather than 
an Israelite midwife or mother. Rahab’s “Passover,” in which 
First Movement: Out of the House of Slaves
56
a crimson symbol over her house saves her whole family from 
destruction, is given specifically to a Gentile woman, rather than 
Israelite men. Hope is stirring.
The musical echoes between the Red Sea and Jordan crossings can also, perhaps surprisingly, help us make sense of the 
violence in Joshua which we find so troubling. When we read 
the two stories alongside each other, and see the conquest of the 
land as the completion of the exodus, the parallels suggest two 
further significant points.
The first is that the instrument of God’s judgment is now the 
people of Israel, rather than the angel of death. Israel is not, as 
it is often suggested, the primary agent in the story, invading 
a land that belongs to someone else, motivated by desire for 
territory, and then using divine sanction to justify it. Quite the 
opposite, actually: God is the primary agent of judgment, and 
he is using Israel as his instrument, much as he had previously 
used the angel on Passover night. The narrative makes this very 
clear. The walls of Jericho fall at the sound of the trumpets, 
not through Israel’s military might (which becomes, literally, 
ridiculous as they march around the city). The commander of 
the Lord’s army, when asked by Joshua whether he is “for us, or 
for our adversaries,” famously answers “No.” (Josh. 5:13–14). 
Furthermore, in contrast to the practice of “ethnic cleansing” or 
“genocide,” faithful Canaanites (Rahab and family) are saved, 
and faithless Israelites (Achan and family) are destroyed. A great 
deal more could be (and has been) said about how we should 
read the conquest stories, but the parallel between the angel 
and Israel shows us that, whatever else we may say about them, 
Israel is the instrument for achieving God’s purposes, not the 
other way around.1
 The battle is the Lord’s, not theirs.
Second, we realize that the tragic story of Achan, who steals 
some of the devoted things from Jericho and keeps them for 
himself, is another fall story, equivalent to the building of the 
golden calf. We might even have seen it coming: Israel has been 
Journey’s End
57
led through the water and given victory over their enemies, but 
instead of destroying the remnants of idolatry, they use them for 
themselves, with the result that three thousand people are defeated in battle, Joshua tears his clothes and cries out to God in 
despair, and God calls the people to execute judgment on those 
who have sinned (Josh. 7:1–26). (In the first exodus story, of 
course, the idolatry is committed by the entire nation, and three 
thousand people are killed, rather than merely fleeing in battle.) 
This reminds us, if we still needed reminding, that Israel’s inheritance of the land does not mean they are now perfect, any more 
than their liberation from Egypt did. Fascinatingly, this fall pattern returns for a third time in the New Testament. No sooner 
has God’s presence come to his people and begun to give them 
victory as a community than a household tries to steal from God 
and ends up killed (Acts 5:1–10). Ananias and Sapphira are the 
new Achan, and Peter the new Joshua.
Having said all that, the main thing we can see as Israel’s 
exodus journey ends—at least for now—is God’s faithful commitment to bring his people into freedom. We have seen unbelief 
and grumbling, rebellion and greed, insurrection and idolatry, 
but we have also seen a God whose covenant promises to his 
children will be kept, come what may. As Joshua leads his people 
into a land flowing with milk and honey, complete with cities 
they did not build and vineyards they did not plant, we are 
reminded that one day freedom will come, and a true and better Joshua will bring God’s people through the waters, rescue 
prostitutes and sinners and Gentiles, and provide them all with 
an inheritance of peace, abundance, and rest. Just not yet.

People of Rest
Genesis 6–9
The story of humanity begins with an exile, not an exodus. That 
is the tragedy of the garden. Instead of leaving a place of slavery and heading for the land flowing with milk and honey, we 
begin our story by leaving the land of abundance and joining the 
world of thorns and thistles, labor pains and death. In a sense, 
the exile from Eden is like Israel’s journey into Egypt, preparing 
us for the liberation of God’s people, and ultimately his world, 
from oppression and frustration, which will ultimately be accomplished in Jesus. In the meantime, however, it also sets the 
stage for the numerous exodus stories that follow. The first of 
these comes to Noah.
The world of Genesis 3–6 looks strikingly similar to the 
world of Exodus 1–2. We have the righteous and the wicked, 
and the wicked are oppressing the righteous, even to the point of 
killing them. Cain has murdered Abel. Lamech has killed a man, 
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
62
and his practice of polygamy may suggest that other men are 
being killed or enslaved. Angelic beings have taken whichever 
human women they choose, and the wickedness of humanity 
is so great that his every intention is only evil, continually. The 
earth is filled with violence.
At the same time, God has heard the cry of the innocent. 
They call upon the name of the Lord (Gen. 4:26), walk with 
God (like Enoch in 5:22), and have found favor in the eyes of 
the Lord as blameless (like Noah in 6:8–9). God, we discover, 
has determined to judge the wicked and liberate the righteous. 
An exodus is coming.
It starts with the birth of a child, and particularly with his 
name: Noah, or “Rest.” Exodus stories often begin with the 
naming of little boys—Moses, Samuel, John, Jesus—and in 
this case the promise is that the world will find “rest” through 
him. Yet Noah, like Moses, will achieve this rest by dividing the 
world. His message of righteousness and trust in God will lead 
to the condemnation of the violent, even as they save his family 
(Heb. 11:7; 2 Pet. 2:5).
God’s means of rescue is, of course, the ark. Owing to children’s Bibles and scientific worries, many of us probably don’t 
think about Noah’s ark that much, but it is rich with symbolic 
significance. It is a pitch-covered vessel designed to keep people 
safe through water, like that which will later save Moses. Its construction is described in detail, with its three decks representing 
the three layers of creation (waters, earth, heavens). It is then 
filled with animal life; a new creation is launched in the middle 
of the old one. There are two of every animal, but seven pairs 
of every clean animal, indicating that sacrifice is coming. Noah, 
it seems, is going to be a new priest in a new world.
Most obviously, from an exodus perspective, the ark is the 
way God keeps his people safe from the watery judgment that 
comes on the wicked. Just as Israel and Egypt both enter the 
Red Sea but only one emerges safe on the other side, so Noah’s 
People of Rest
63
family and the rest of the known world enter the floodwaters, 
but only one makes it out alive. Just as Israel escaped judgment 
at Passover as they went inside their homes and closed the doors, 
so Noah leads his family inside the ark, “and the Lord shut him 
in” (Gen. 7:16). Just as Moses sent out messengers to spy out the 
land, so Noah sends out a raven and a dove to see if the floodwaters have subsided. Just as God remembered Israel and led them 
to a mountain where he gave them a new covenant, new laws, 
and ultimately rest, so God remembers Noah (8:1) and brings 
him safely to a mountain, where he receives a new covenant, 
new laws, and a place of rest. Noah is Moses. Ararat is Sinai.
The parallels cut both ways, however. By now, we know to 
expect that exodus stories are often followed by fall stories, and 
that is exactly what happens here. God commissions Noah’s 
family to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, and reiterates 
that they share the divine image. Noah begins well by planting 
a vineyard, a symbol of fruitfulness, completion, and rest (as 
the Promised Land is later associated with luscious grapes and 
abundant wine). The next thing we know, the Land of Promise 
has once again become the site of temptation and fall. Commission, fruit, temptation, sin, nakedness, shame, clothing, a curse, 
a blessing, and finally death: the story of Genesis 9 is painfully 
familiar. Noah’s exodus has brought judgment on the wicked 
and freedom for the oppressed, but humans are still fallen and 
sin is still here. A greater exodus is still needed.
It is no wonder that Peter sees this whole story as a picture of 
baptism (1 Pet. 3:18–22). On its own, the flooding of the known 
world might not look like a promising analogy for the beginning 
of the Christian life. But Peter sees baptism as one more example 
of a frequent musical theme in Scripture: that God’s people are 
repeatedly “brought safely through water” (v. 20). God has a 
regular habit of using water to divide his people from the world 
around them, and protecting them from judgment, so it is only 
natural that the start of the Christian life would be marked off 
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
64
by a journey through water. “Baptism, which corresponds to 
this, now saves you,” Peter writes in verse 21 (causing flutters 
of concern to all good Protestants, but that’s another story). We, 
like Noah, have found favor in God’s eyes, been placed within 
One who can save us from the coming judgment, been sealed 
inside by the hand of God, and then been brought through water 
into a land of covenant, promise, and fruitfulness. A Christian 
is a Noah. We are people of rest.

Genesis 10–15
Abram lives an exodus-shaped life, from beginning to end. So 
do most members of his family (as we will see in chap. 9). As 
the father of a people whose identity is fundamentally shaped 
by their exodus experience, this may not be surprising; we have 
already seen how God often prepares people in the early stages 
of their lives for what they will face later (something he still does 
today, incidentally). Nevertheless, the number of variations on 
the exodus theme are remarkable.
It all starts with a building project. Nimrod, a descendant of 
Noah’s son Ham, has founded the city of Babel. The descendants 
of Shem have moved east and joined in the construction of a city 
and a tower, hoping to make a name for themselves (rather than 
God), and to protect themselves from being scattered across the 
earth (rather than filling the earth, as God had commissioned 
them). For both of these reasons, the Lord is preparing to destroy 
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
66
the city and scatter the men who have built it. So as Abraham’s 
exodus is about to begin, we have Semites serving a blasphemous, Hamite imperial building project, and God preparing to 
bring judgment on the people and humiliate the gods they serve. 
All of these melodies will reappear in Exodus 1.
Terah, Abram, and their family come from Ur, which is near 
Babel, in what we now call Iraq. As we are introduced to them, 
we get a couple of clues that Ur is not only a place of idolatry but 
also a place of barrenness. Haran, Abram’s brother, dies there. 
Sarai, his wife, is infertile. Terah is leading his family away from 
Ur and toward the land of Canaan. They make it only halfway, 
and settle instead in Haran (which is presumably named after 
Abram’s dead brother), where Terah himself dies. Abram’s family, which we later discover is large and prosperous, is being 
led from a land of barrenness into a Land of Promise, together 
with all their flocks and herds. This is an exodus journey in the 
making.
Like Israel’s journey out of Egypt, Abram’s exodus happens 
in two stages, with a lengthy stopover in the middle. The delay 
in Haran resembles the delay in the wilderness: the older generation dies out, others from outside of the family are added, and 
the new generation is given the crucial instruction to go in and 
inherit the Land. This instruction is one of the key turning points 
in the whole of Scripture: “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land I will show you. And I 
will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make 
your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those 
who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in 
you all the families of the earth will be blessed” (Gen. 12:1–3). 
Abram, like Moses and Joshua, does not chart his own course, 
but has to trust that the Lord will lead him (“the land I will show 
you”). The men of Babel, like Pharaoh, were building cities and 
seeking a name for themselves; Abram, like Israel, has to trust 
that he will be given a great name by God.

Abram journeys throughout the land, together with his 
household, “all their possessions that they had gathered, and 
the people that they had acquired in Haran” (Gen. 12:5). This 
is a large group—if Abraham has 318 fighting men (14:14), then 
the entire community may have numbered two thousand—and 
would certainly have attracted attention. As they move from 
the north to Shechem in the center, then down to Bethel and 
Ai, and finally into the Negeb in the south, they are doing what 
Joshua will later do, and claiming the land for the Lord. Yet this 
is no military conquest. Abram lifts no weapons and fights no 
battles; instead, he builds an altar on a mountain, establishing 
true worship, and calls upon—or proclaims—the name of the 
Lord (12:8), probably calling the Canaanites to worship him 
too. In a sense, it is a spiritual conquest, similar to that which 
Jesus will later bring about as he walks the same earth and proclaims the same God.
No sooner is Abram’s first exodus complete than his second 
begins (Gen. 12:10–20). Abram and Sarai, like their future descendants, leave the land of Canaan as a result of famine and 
head for Egypt. While there, the life of the male is threatened 
and the female risks being taken as a captive bride, and both are 
saved only through deception. The beautiful Israelite is taken 
into Pharaoh’s house. Because Pharaoh does not let the bride 
leave, God afflicts him and his household with great plagues. 
Pharaoh blames Abram for making trouble, when it is actually 
Pharaoh who is at fault.1
 Eventually Pharaoh releases them: 
“take her, and go” (v. 12:19). As they leave, they take Pharaoh’s 
slaves with them, along with all the possessions they have gained 
while in Egypt, and they arrive back in the land of Canaan far 
richer than when they had left it. (Notice that a number of these 
themes—the attack upon the bride, escape through deception, 
divine plagues upon the ruler, and the giving of spoils—reappear 
when Abraham and Sarah stay in Gerah in Genesis 20. Personal 
exoduses, it seems, are habit-forming.)
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
68
It is fascinating to watch. We see the exodus story played 
out in Abram’s life, then in his extended family, then in the 
entire nation which comes from him, and then in the greater 
exodus accomplished in Jesus. It is like looking at a row of 
Russian dolls of increasing size lined up next to each other. 
Not only do the dolls look similar, but they also fit inside 
each other, revealing an internal unity. Abram is able to sum 
up the entire nation of Israel in himself, not least in his exodus journeys, just as Jesus will. That type of summing-up-inhimself, in fact, is at the heart of the gospel. Things that are 
true of our representative become, graciously and gloriously, 
true of us.
We find the most explicit reference to the exodus in Abram’s 
story in Genesis 15, where God makes a covenant with him. 
After promising Abram offspring like the stars of the sky and 
counting his faith as righteousness, God speaks to him about 
the exodus that will come to his future family. He identifies 
himself as “the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the 
Chaldeans” (v. 7), just as he will later identify himself as “the 
Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt” 
(Ex. 20:2). He then specifies all the key details of the exodus 
story: Abram’s seed will be in a foreign land; they will be enslaved and afflicted; their enslavement will last four hundred 
years; their oppressors will face judgment; and they will reenter 
the Land with great possessions. The ceremony that accompanies this covenant, which includes animal corpses cut in half, 
carries an intriguing resemblance to Passover. Great emphasis 
is placed on darkness, sacrificial animals, and a smoking fire 
pot and flaming torch of God’s presence “passing through” the 
pieces. It is as if God is saying, not just in speech but in symbol: 
Your family will be numerous, but they will face oppression. 
It will be long and painful. But you need to trust me. I am the 
God who brings out.
As Abraham’s seed, we still do. As Abraham’s God, he still is.

Just Like Us
Genesis 16–26
Abraham is the fountainhead of God’s people. As the Scriptures 
unfold, we find all sorts of ways in which his life is representative of his entire offspring—his call to bless all the nations, faith, 
credited righteousness, covenant, promises, and obedience. We 
hear echoes of his life throughout the pages of Genesis. So it is 
not surprising to find his exodus journeys reflected in the lives of 
his immediate family, including Hagar, Ishmael, Isaac, Rebekah, 
and Lot.
Hagar is the first woman in the Bible to experience an exodus all on her own, and she actually experiences two. In Genesis 16 an innocent slave (Hagar) is afflicted by her slave mistress 
(Sarai) and escapes into the wilderness of Shur, where she finds 
water in the desert, has an angelic encounter, receives promises 
of fruitfulness and blessing, receives revelation of God’s name, 
sees God, and returns to the land of Canaan with divine bless-
Just Like Us
71
ing. The melody is then repeated in Genesis 21, but with an 
important variation. Hagar, like Moses, is alone in the first 
flight into the wilderness, but she takes the family with her in 
the second. She cries, and God hears the voice of her son (as 
he will when Israel cries) and provides for him (as he will for 
Israel), and the son lives in the wilderness of Paran (as Israel 
will). This is the exodus story in miniature.
Abraham’s first two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, also experience 
exodus journeys, which harmonize closely with one another. 
Ishmael’s begins when Abraham rises early in the morning, and 
the boy is taken by his mother into the wilderness. He nearly 
dies, but the angel of the Lord rescues him, as his mother opens 
her eyes and sees a well, and Ishmael receives God’s promises 
and presence (21:9–21). Isaac’s journey begins when Abraham 
rises early in the morning, and the boy is taken by his father 
into the wilderness. He nearly dies, but the angel of the Lord 
rescues him, as his father opens his eyes and sees a ram, and 
Isaac receives God’s promises and presence (22:1–19). So, as in 
the exodus from Egypt, we have a journey into the wilderness, 
angelic rescue from the near death of the firstborn son, miraculous provision, and divine promises (on a mountain, in Isaac’s 
case). For all the contrasts between Ishmael and Isaac that we 
find in Scripture, and there are many, we have a number of 
exodus-shaped similarities, too.
Then we have Isaac and Rebekah, whose exodus journey from 
Gerah in Genesis 26 is remarkably similar to that of Abraham 
and Sarah in Genesis 20. Famine drives them out of their own 
land and into a foreign country, where they deceive the king for 
their own protection (the wife/sister ploy again). They become 
extremely prosperous as a result of divine blessing. This growth 
makes them a threat to the local people, and the king urges them 
to leave: “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we” 
(26:16). The Philistines have blocked all of Abraham’s wells, 
which might remind us of the blocked wombs they experienced 
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
72
when Abimelech took Sarah into his harem (20:18). On leaving 
the land, Isaac and Rebekah move from place to place, struggling to find water in dry places and occasionally contending 
with their enemies, before eventually finding a place to settle. 
In light of the Joshua story, it is striking that Isaac names the 
place Rehoboth (“room”), saying, “For now the Lord has made 
room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land” (26:22).
Most dramatic of all is the story of Lot and his family and 
their narrow escape from Sodom. The connection between 
Sodom and Egypt is first introduced in Genesis 13:10, with 
both described as “well watered everywhere like the garden of 
the Lord,” and this natural fertility is why Lot chose to live in 
Sodom in the first place. But from the moment the Lord appears 
in Abraham’s doorway in Genesis 18, we find a flurry of connections between the exodus from Sodom and the exodus from 
Egypt. God promises a son to Abraham and Sarah, announcing 
the end of their period of barrenness, and immediately goes on 
to judge the wicked city, accompanied by two witnesses (like 
Moses and Aaron). The rite of circumcision is instituted or established just beforehand. The angels are passing by (18:3–5), 
just as they will later in Egypt. An evening meal of unleavened 
bread is eaten (19:3). There is a threat to life at a doorway, and 
the angels haul Lot back inside and shut the door, to protect 
him from the judgment to come (19:4–11). God urges Lot to 
leave the city with all his relatives and possessions, because the 
“outcry” against the city has reached the Lord’s ears (19:12–14). 
The angels lead Lot and his family out, and urge him to head for 
the mountain, lest he be “swept away” (19:15–17). As the sun 
rises, destruction from heaven falls upon Sodom and Gomorrah 
(19:23–25). Lot’s family escapes the city alive, thanks to divine 
protection, and a pillar of witness is established (19:26).
At the same time, Lot’s exodus is in many ways an anti-exodus, 
contrasting with the exoduses of Abraham that bookend it on 
both sides. Lot wants to go back to a place like Egypt, rather 
Just Like Us
73
than to escape it, and as a result he loses possessions rather than 
gaining them. Lot’s doorway, unlike the doorways in the Passover and Abraham stories, becomes a place of threat and death, 
rather than rescue and promise. Both Lot’s sons-in-law and Sarah 
think that God’s promise is a joke, but whereas the laughter in 
Abraham’s family is followed by new life—and a child named 
Isaac, or “laughter”—the laughter in Lot’s family leads to destruction. Abraham’s wife is miraculously made fruitful; Lot’s 
wife is miraculously made barren as a pillar of salt. Abraham 
lives in a tent and becomes the father of many nations by his wife. 
Lot lives in a cave, a symbol of the grave, and becomes the father 
of two nations by his incestuous daughters (19:30–38).
What do we make of all these exodus journeys amongst 
Abraham’s family? At one level, they remind us that God is orchestrating history, Scripture, and the individual circumstances 
of his people, and has been since the beginning. At another, they 
show us the solidarity between Abraham and the members of 
his family—what happens to him happens, somehow, to them—
which is itself an important ingredient in the gospel, as Paul will 
explain with such passion in Romans and Galatians. But there is 
at least one musical phrase in the story of Abraham’s family that 
appears nowhere else, and it is enormously encouraging for the 
Christian life. Lot, like all of us, is rescued in spite of himself.
The other exodus stories we have seen so far involve a cry 
for help, or at least some awareness on the part of the oppressed 
that there is a problem. Here, by contrast, the cry that reaches 
heaven is an outcry against the city, not a cry for help from 
within it. Lot is ensconced in Sodom, oblivious to the judgment 
heading his way. He is not particularly looking to be rescued. 
He is an elder in the city (19:1), and even as destruction is coming, he lingers (19:16). He is staring death in the face, and he 
doesn’t even know it.
Yet God, in his grace, saves him anyway. Lot does not particularly care about being saved, but the priestly prayers of his 
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
74
righteous family member avail for him—“Shall not the Judge of 
all the earth do what is just?”—even though Lot doesn’t know 
anything about them (18:25). At Abraham’s request, God intervenes. Angels visit Lot’s house, compel him back indoors when 
danger comes, and urge him to flee along with his family. When, 
in spite of all of this, he still stays put, “the men seized him and 
his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being 
merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside 
the city” (19:16). He is dragged away from fiery destruction by 
the hand of God, not because of anything he himself has done, 
but because of God’s mercy.
Just as we are.

Wrestling with God
Genesis 27–50
It can be hard to tell the difference between an exodus and an 
exile, especially when you’re in the middle of one. When Isaac’s 
son Jacob first ran away from his brother, Esau, after tricking 
him out of both his birthright and his blessing, it must have 
felt like an exile: an extended period of servitude in a foreign 
land, despite possessing promises of fruitfulness and blessing. 
In truth, this was the opening scene of an exodus story, which 
culminated in the founding of a nation. But Jacob could not 
have known that.
Rebekah, Jacob’s mother, had urged him to flee to her brother 
Laban’s house in Haran, which is the very town where Abram 
had stayed on his journey from Ur to Canaan. The exodus setup 
is familiar by now. A member of Abraham’s family heads to a 
new land, where he is at first welcomed, but gradually becomes 
diminished in status (treated as a servant rather than a relative), 
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
76
mistreated (tricked into marrying two daughters rather than 
one), and oppressed by a serpent figure (Laban). The women in 
the story are also mistreated by the serpent figure, who in this 
case is their father: Rachel is denied exclusive rights to her husband, and Leah is forced into marriage as an unloved wife. God, 
however, hears the cry of the oppressed women, and begins to 
bless them with children, who eventually lead the twelve tribes 
of Israel. Despite their oppression, Jacob’s family prospers, is 
fruitful, and multiplies, and the opening scene concludes with 
the birth of the miraculous child, Joseph, who will later deliver 
them from disaster (Gen. 29:1–30:24). All of these themes will 
resurface in Exodus 1–2.
The birth of Joseph, like the birth of Moses, is the sign that the 
long period of servitude is about to come to an end: “As soon as 
Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, ‘Send me away, 
that I may go to my own home and country’” (30:25). Jacob, like 
Moses, approaches his master and asks to be allowed to leave, accompanied by his entire family. Laban, like Pharaoh, says no. After 
some negotiation, in which Laban shows himself once again to be 
a manipulative taskmaster, Jacob is allowed some independence 
with “a distance of three days’ journey” (v. 36) between them, just 
as Moses will later demand from Pharaoh. Jacob, like Israel, plunders his former master—it is important to the story that his wages 
are taken rather than given—and grows enormously wealthy 
(vv. 25–43). He then receives an angelic commission to return to 
his homeland, flees from Laban with all he has, crosses a large 
river (the Euphrates), and heads for the mountain (of Gilead), until 
the third day (31:1–21). You couldn’t make this stuff up.
Laban, like Pharaoh, is angry at being tricked, and gives 
chase. Yet instead of the showdown we might expect—Laban 
being swept away by a wall of water, or at least being afflicted 
with a few boils or something—we have the rather farcical anticlimax of Laban searching for his stolen household gods, all 
while his daughter Rachel is sitting on them, refusing to get 
Wrestling with God
77
up because it’s her time of the month (31:25–35). Even this, 
however, reflects the exodus themes of women tricking the tyrant, and more importantly, the humiliation of false gods and 
their contrast with the real one. The God of Jacob’s father has 
appeared to him at Bethel, accompanied him throughout his 
journeys, and brought him great prosperity. The gods of Leah 
and Rachel’s father cannot even rescue themselves from being 
captured and then sat upon by a menstruating woman.
In a strange twist, Laban and Jacob then establish a covenant 
together. Although Laban’s main role in Jacob’s exodus story 
is to play the part of Pharaoh, in a curious sense he also plays 
the part of Jethro, the father-in-law who meets Israel just after 
their escape and establishes friendship. They mark the covenant 
by means of a heap of stones, just as Israel does before taking 
Jericho. Jacob’s exodus journey is nearly over.
But not quite. First he has to undertake a nighttime crossing 
of the Jabbok, a tributary of the River Jordan, and to wrestle 
with an unnamed man until dawn (Gen. 32:22–32). The second 
river crossing has an obvious exodus connection: if the Euphrates (like the Red Sea) represents departure from servitude, the 
Jabbok (like the Jordan) represents entrance into inheritance, 
and we can see this worked out in Jacob’s reconciliation with 
Esau and his safe arrival in the land of Canaan (33:1–20). The 
wrestling at Peniel is more subtle, though. It is as if Jacob has 
spent his life wrestling with men—Isaac, Esau, Laban—only to 
discover that he has actually been wrestling with God, in and 
through these individuals. It is very possible that, fording a river 
in the dark, Jacob thought that the man he was wrestling actually was Esau (whom he was scared of meeting) or even Laban 
(from whom he had been fleeing), which might explain his desperation to find out the man’s name. Only as dawn is about to 
break does Jacob realize that he has been wrestling with God 
himself, and he receives a new name: Israel, or “he struggles 
with God” (32:28).
Second Movement: The Exodus in Genesis
78
I wonder whether it was this scene that gave C. S. Lewis 
the idea of Shasta’s conversation with Aslan in The Horse and 
His Boy. The young boy has been harassed by various lions 
throughout his journey, but as the story nears its climax, Shasta 
discovers that it was Aslan all along:
I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the 
cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was 
the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I 
was the lion who gave the Horses the new strength of fear 
for the last mile so that you should reach King Lune in time. 
And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the 
boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to 
shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.1
Jacob, now named Israel, is in awe. “I have seen God face to 
face,” he exclaims, “and yet my life has been delivered” (Gen. 
32:30). This, of course, will also be the story of the nation to 
whom he gives his name.
Before Genesis closes we hear about one more exodus, which 
sets the scene for the great exodus to come under Moses: that 
of Jacob’s favored son, Joseph (Genesis 37–45). Like Moses, 
Joseph is set apart from his brothers at birth and finds himself 
rejected by them, leading him into a wilderness in which he encounters violent shepherds and then has to wait a long time before bringing the deliverance he has been promised. Like Moses, 
Joseph brings rescue to an entire nation from the plague (in this 
case famine) that God is bringing upon Egypt, so that other nations might be blessed. Like Moses, Joseph is a prince of Egypt 
who ends up humiliating their gods as powerless before the 
Lord. Like Moses, Joseph leads his family/nation out of impending disaster into a land of abundance, but has to lead them first 
through a series of trials. Like Moses, Joseph dies in a manner 
that points forward to the inheritance of the Promised Land.
Yet unlike Moses, this is an exodus not out of Egypt, but into 
Wrestling with God
79
it. And in a manner only somewhat like Moses—but very much 
like Jesus—this is an exodus that Joseph experiences personally 
first. He is sold as a slave, wrongfully accused, thrown into the 
pit, raised up again, and exalted to the right hand of the Power. 
Only then, in and through him, do God’s glorious blessings 
come to the world, and to his brothers. Hallelujah.

OF EXODUS

Wings of Refuge
Ruth
The book of Ruth is such a touching love story and such a 
charming tale of emptiness to abundance that we can easily 
think there is nothing more to it. Naomi loses her husband, her 
sons, and her joy, but one of her daughters-in-law sticks with 
her, gets married, and gives her a grandson. Boaz is one of the 
good guys and does the right thing even though he risks losing 
the woman he loves—but he wins her anyway. Ruth is bereaved 
and bereft, but then meets a man who is kind to her and who 
ends up redeeming and marrying her. They all live happily ever 
after.
There is, however, more going on here. From a historical 
point of view, Ruth is a crucial hinge in the story of Israel, marking the transition from the age of the judges to the age of the 
kings (which the writer highlights by starting the book with “in 
the days when the judges ruled,” and finishing it with the word 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
84
“David.”).1 From a Christian point of view, the first two explicit 
Old Testament references to King David are in this book, and 
the way in which Ruth, as a Gentile woman, gets incorporated 
into Israel—through the kindness and redemption of a man 
from the tribe of Judah—has encouraged the church for centuries. And from a musical point of view, it is another exodus 
story. It is also, in many ways, an upside-down one.
Naomi is Israel. Famine is in the land, so she and her husband leave for a foreign country, where they are initially able 
to find food. But the place of plenty becomes a place of death 
to her: first her husband, Elimelech, then her sons, Mahlon and 
Chilion, die in Moab. While there, she hears that her homeland 
is now a place of abundance, so she leaves the foreign country to 
return home, taking her two (foreign) daughters-in-law with her. 
On the journey, the older one turns back, while the younger one 
continues toward the land, and they finally arrive in Bethlehem, 
the “house of bread.” This story has a clear exodus shape.
Yet it is an exodus gone wrong, an exodus with a bitter twist. 
When Israel went down to Egypt to avoid famine, they multiplied and became numerous, and food and drink were supernaturally provided as they approached the land flowing with 
milk and honey. When Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob went abroad, 
they became wealthy, and returned home with prosperity and 
abundance. Exodus stories are supposed to involve people going 
out empty and coming back full.
But Naomi’s exodus is not like this. “I went away full, and 
the Lord has brought me back empty,” she laments (Ruth 1:21). 
She has lost her husband and her sons. She is unable to have 
more children. She is in need of food and land. She is so desperate that she gives herself a new name: “Do not call me Naomi; 
call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me” 
(v. 20). We hear darker notes than we are used to in exodus 
stories. The melody of redemption has been soured.
In many ways, Naomi’s confusion reflects the state of Israel 
Wings of Refuge
85
in the period of the judges. We have had our exodus, Israel 
might think, and we are now back in the land—but we are not 
living in the abundance we had hoped for. We are widowed. We 
face death every day. Our food, our children, our land, and our 
dignity are being taken by our enemies (think of Gideon in the 
winepress, for instance). The Lord has dealt bitterly with us. The 
God of the exodus has gone quiet. Where is his mighty hand or 
his outstretched arm? How long, O Lord?
When redemption eventually comes, it comes in a way that 
reveals all sorts of other exodus connections. Naomi is redeemed 
as she incorporates a foreign nation (in the form of Ruth) into 
her family, just as Israel was. Boaz, the redeemer, insists that the 
poor and the sojourner should be able to glean freely from the 
grain fields and invites Ruth to eat and drink at his table, just as 
the Lord did. Ruth ends up with far more food than she could 
possibly have gained for herself, thanks to the generosity of her 
redeemer, just as Israel did. Boaz redeems Ruth in order that he 
might marry her, just as God did with Israel.
One of the subtler echoes of the exodus is the language of 
“wings.” As Israel arrives at Sinai having just been led out of 
Egypt, God describes their rescue like this: “You yourselves have 
seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ 
wings and brought you to myself” (Ex. 19:4). As if to symbolize 
this, the cherubim that guard the ark of the covenant are built 
with outstretched wings, and the Song of Moses pictures God 
leading Israel like an eagle leads its young, “spreading out its 
wings, catching them, bearing them on its pinions” (Deut. 32:11).
God’s wings disappear in Joshua and Judges, only to reappear again here, as Boaz describes Ruth’s quest for safety in 
God: “[May] a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of 
Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge” (Ruth 
2:12). The God whose wingspan provides protection until the 
raging storm has passed by is present to bless Ruth and deliver 
her, as he was with Israel as they left Egypt. Ruth gets the point, 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
86
and in that famous scene when she asks Boaz to redeem her, she 
urges him, “Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a 
redeemer” (3:9). Israel could have said exactly the same thing as 
they fled Pharaoh. The God of the exodus is back.
As the book reaches its conclusion, and the redemption of 
Ruth and Naomi is accomplished, we finally see how the musical 
themes in Ruth parallel not just the Lord’s redemption of Israel 
from Egypt, but Christ’s redemption of his people from sin. Like 
Ruth when she first meets Boaz, we are outsiders when we first 
meet Jesus: homeless, estranged, hungry, and empty. We come to 
him because we’ve heard that he is worthy, a man who blesses 
those in search of food and lifts the needy from the ash heap 
(1 Sam. 2:8). He says to us, as Boaz essentially says to Ruth, 
“Don’t go anywhere else. Keep close to me, and I’ll make sure 
you’re looked after.”
We look shocked, like Ruth, and ask: “Why have I found 
favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am 
a foreigner?” (Ruth 2:10). Christ says to us: “The Lord repay 
you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by 
the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come 
to take refuge!” (2:12). He invites us to his table: Here, take 
bread, and dip it in the wine. We accept and lie down at his feet, 
asking for his wings of safety to cover us. He rescues us with joy 
and commits not just to redeem but also to “marry” us. And 
when those around us see the results of the gospel in our lives, 
they say what the women say to Naomi: “Blessed be the Lord, 
who has not left you this day without a redeemer!” (4:14).
Because of the God of the exodus, they all live happily ever 
after. For all the anguish of loss and displacement and waiting, 
Naomi ends the story no longer empty but full: “A son has been 
born to Naomi” (Ruth 4:17). So does Ruth, her outsider, widowed, Gentile daughter-in-law. So does Boaz, the worthy man 
who becomes the great-grandfather of David.
So do we.

The Capture of God
1 Samuel 1–7
Scripture gives us many clues when an exodus story is about to 
begin. Evil rulers, for instance. Famines. Journeys into foreign 
lands. Women outmaneuvering powerful men. Battles between 
gods. The oppression of the innocent. A barren woman crying 
out for a child is a strong hint that a work of redemption is on 
its way. But if she then gets pregnant and bursts into song about 
how God is going to bring down the mighty and exalt the humble, it’s a dead giveaway. Welcome to the world of 1 Samuel.
The prayers and courage of faithful women, and childless 
women in particular, are often the means by which God rescues 
his people from the tyranny and abuse of faithless men. Sarah, 
Rebekah, Rachel, the Israelite midwives, Ruth, Hannah, Abigail, Esther, Elizabeth, Mary: God revels in overthrowing the 
strong through vessels of weakness. At the start of 1 Samuel it is 
Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli the priest, who are abusing 
The Capture of God
89
their privilege and oppressing the innocent, and it is Hannah, the 
childless wife, who is crying out in desperate prayer. And God 
hears. As with Israel in Egypt, the cry of Hannah goes up to the 
Lord, he “remembers” her (1:19), and when she has given birth 
to Samuel (“God hears”), she sings a song celebrating the way 
God is turning the world upside down (2:1–10). The mighty will 
be crushed. The feeble will be strong. The poor will be rich. A 
thousand years later, a pregnant young woman will pray almost 
identical things, with even greater significance (Luke 1:46–55).
Yet the rescue does not take the form we might expect. Reading 1 Samuel after reading all these exodus stories is like listening to a piece of music where a set melody has been established, 
and then suddenly hearing a totally unpredictable chord that 
confounds our expectations. When Hannah’s little boy grows 
up, he does not lead Israel into a foreign nation and then out 
again. In fact, despite all our assumptions, it is God himself who 
goes into the foreign nation, and God himself who comes out 
again in triumph, having crushed his enemies. The tune is the 
same shape, but the key has changed.
Israel is at war with the Philistines. To compensate for an 
early defeat at Aphek, the elders of Israel decide to bring the ark 
of the covenant up from Shiloh, “that it may come among us 
and save us from the power of our enemies” (1 Sam. 4:3). The 
Philistine response—which, interestingly, appeals to the exodus 
from Egypt as motivation (4:8–9)—is to fight all the harder, and 
for the first and only time in history, the ark of God is captured 
by a foreign power. When he hears the news, Eli collapses and 
dies. Hophni and Phinehas fall in battle. The wife of Phinehas 
gives birth to a child she names Ichabod (“the glory has gone!”), 
and then dies. Not for the last time in 1 Samuel, the entire ruling 
dynasty has been laid waste in a single day.
The ark of the Lord, meanwhile, is taken captive. It is a mark 
of God’s grace that he, substituting for the nation as a whole, 
goes into exile. Israel remains in the Land, while God takes 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
90
on the consequences of their failures (again, not for the last 
time). But the Philistines get more than they had bargained for. 
As Pharaoh and Abimelech found with Abram and Sarai, and 
Egypt found with Israel, hosting the people of God is a dangerous game, particularly when you are trying to take advantage of 
them—and it is far worse when you try it with the presence of 
God himself. The morning after the Philistines put the ark in the 
temple of their god, they find Dagon bowing down before the 
Lord. Assuming some sort of unfortunate deity mishap—a slippery floor, perhaps?—they take Dagon “and put him back in his 
place” (1 Sam. 5:3). The scene the next morning is not pretty. 
Dagon has lost his hands and his head, like every defeated serpent. The battle of the gods has been won by the one true God.
Then the plagues begin. First the city of Ashdod, then Gath 
and Ekron, are struck with tumors as the ark is passed from 
town to town like a (very dangerous) hot potato. For anyone 
familiar with the disasters that struck Egypt, it is all too familiar: “The hand of the Lord was heavy against the people”; 
“The cry of the city went up to heaven” (1 Sam. 5:6, 12). The 
people urged their leaders to “send away the ark of the God 
of Israel” (5:11). Finally, the leaders “called for the priests and 
the diviners” to find out what to do (6:2), and they were given 
an emphatic answer: “Why should you harden your hearts as 
the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had 
dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and 
they departed?” (6:6). Learning from Egypt’s example, and their 
experience of being plundered by Israel at night, they decide to 
send the ark back to Israel complete with gifts—although, in a 
tragic but not unprecedented twist, God’s “exodus” journey is 
marred by rebellion among the people (6:19–21), and the ark 
does not reach its final destination for another hundred years 
or so (2 Sam. 6:1–19).
Nevertheless, the story concludes where exodus stories usually do: with the successful conquest of the Land and the driving 
The Capture of God
91
out of God’s enemies. Samuel, like Joshua, gathers the nation 
and calls the people to put away their false gods and serve the 
Lord only (1 Sam. 7:3). After repenting and praying, Israel prepares for battle against the Philistines, only to find—as they 
did at Jericho—that the battle is won by God, through very 
unconventional means (7:10). Samuel even leads the people to 
set up a memorial stone, as Joshua had done after crossing the 
Jordan, and he names it Ebenezer (“stone of help”): “Till now, 
the Lord has helped us” (7:12). The tragedy of the Battle of 
Aphek has been reversed, and the Land is secure. The weak have 
been made strong and the powerful have been crushed, just as 
Hannah prophesied they would.
What Hannah never predicted, however, was the means by 
which this great reversal would take place. The story does not 
turn on the battlefield, through strategy or strength, at Aphek or 
Ebenezer. The story turns as the ark of the covenant is captured, 
placed before a foreign god in a foreign temple, and left there as 
a sign of God’s defeat and humiliation. Like Samson a few years 
later, the ark is placed in the temple of Dagon to show Philistine 
strength and Israelite weakness, with all God’s enemies mocking and gloating. And it is in this context—at the climax of the 
Philistines’ victory—that the great reversal takes place. Israel’s 
God triumphs, not in spite of his humiliation, but somehow 
through it. Samson, Israel’s champion, bows his head, stretches 
out his arms, and kills more in his death than he had killed in 
his life. The ark of God saves a nation by being captured. And 
the head of Dagon is crushed.
One day, not far from the city of Ashdod, God will be 
captured again. He will be seized, paraded in front of foreigners and their gods, ridiculed, mocked, and humiliated. At the 
moment of his greatest weakness—naked, nailed, and bleeding, as his enemies spit and cast lots for his clothes—the great 
reversal will take place, and Israel’s God will triumph not in 
spite of his humiliation, but somehow through it. Jesus, Israel’s 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
92
true champion, will bow his head, stretch out his arms, and 
save more in his death than he had saved in his life. The Son 
of God will save a nation by being captured. And the head of 
the dragon will be crushed.

1 Samuel 15–2 Samuel 24
Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s say we didn’t know who had 
written any of David’s psalms. Then let’s say that we were told 
they were all written by the same major biblical character, and 
we had to guess which one. Who would we think had written 
them?
Think about it for a moment. The psalmist describes being 
pursued by enemies (Ps. 7:1) and sinking into the mire as the 
waters come up to his neck (69:1–2). He speaks of a change of 
fortunes in the early morning (143:8), being rescued from the 
rush of mighty waters (32:6), and seeing his enemies falling into 
the trap that they had set (9:15), while he is brought out of the 
bog onto solid ground (40:2). He talks about God being present in the clouds (18:11), and the angel of the Lord camping 
around him (34:7). He praises God for sending hailstones on his 
enemies, thundering from heaven, and exposing the channels of 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
94
the sea by the blast of his nostrils (18:12–15). He rejoices at the 
defeat of those who trust in horses and chariots (20:7–8), and 
worships God the rock (18:2), for whom he longs as if desperate 
for water in the middle of a desert (63:1). He calls upon God to 
arise and let his enemies scatter (68:1). He celebrates the gift of 
the law (19:7–13) and the way God leads his people into a home 
of prosperity (68:6). If it weren’t for all those references to “the 
king,” I think we might guess that these psalms were written not 
by David but by Moses.
You could argue that this is nothing more than poetic imagery. The exodus story looms large in Israel’s thinking, as we 
have seen throughout this book, so of course leaders would 
structure their songs around that story. But when we take a 
closer look at David’s life, as it is told in Samuel and Chronicles, 
we see that David sang exodus-shaped songs because, from 
start to finish, he lived an exodus-shaped life.
Almost as soon as he is introduced, David is thrust into a 
high-profile confrontation with a powerful man whose nation 
is oppressing God’s people. David against Goliath, like Moses 
versus Pharaoh, is a battle of the gods played out through two 
men, complete with the usual warnings, threats, and trash talk. 
The stakes are incredibly high: slavery for the loser, victory and 
land for the winner. As Pharaoh is described as a dragon who 
ends up getting pierced (Isa. 51:9; Ezek. 29:3), so Goliath is 
pictured as a villainous snake, covered in scaly armor (1 Sam. 
17:5), lying in wait in the Valley of Elah and spewing forth accusations. David, like Moses, has no qualifications other than 
the experience of having kept sheep, and the fear of the living 
God. You know the result. Like the original serpent, and like 
the dragon in the depths of the Red Sea, Goliath ends up getting 
crushed, with his head bruised and eventually removed. Israel’s 
men—despite their obvious fear of giants—rush up out of the 
valley in triumph, and the women pick up their tambourines and 
sing in victorious celebration. Israel’s God is vindicated.
All about the House
95
Yet the story is only just starting, because Goliath is not the 
only Pharaoh-like character David will face. No sooner has the 
spear-wielding Philistine been killed than we find, ominously, 
another character picking up a spear and using it to threaten 
the future king: “Saul had his spear in his hand. And Saul 
hurled the spear, for he thought, ‘I will pin David to the wall’” 
(1 Sam. 18:10–11). The transfer of the spear shows us that 
the mantle of oppression has passed from Goliath to Saul, and 
with it, the threat to Israel’s safety and inheritance. Saul is the 
new Pharaoh.
Like Pharaoh, Saul tries to kill the anointed leader while he 
is still young, but fails, ironically through the intervention of 
his own daughter. Like Pharaoh, Saul brings his adversary into 
his household. Like Pharaoh, Saul’s attempts to destroy his rival 
lead to an escape at nighttime, through the substitution of an 
animal (1 Sam. 19:11–17). Like Pharaoh, Saul hardens his heart 
and pursues his opponent, to the eventual destruction of both 
himself and his family.
David, meanwhile, flees the pursuing king and ends up wandering in the wilderness. At the first place he stops he receives 
holy bread, the bread of the Presence, which reminds us of the 
manna provided from heaven for Israel (1 Sam. 21:1–6). He 
leads a grumbling group of malcontents in the middle of nowhere (22:1–5). He is opposed by Edomites, just as Israel was 
in the wilderness (22:11–19). He spends time in a foreign nation 
under a foreign king, is given a portion of land for himself, eventually leaves with a large company of people, and defeats the 
Amalekites (27:1–30:31). The striking difference is that whereas 
Moses and Israel sang for joy at the defeat of the king who was 
trying to kill them (“The Lord is a man of war!” Ex. 15:3), 
David sings a lament (“How the mighty have fallen!” 2 Sam. 
1:19, 25, 27). Both the stories of Moses and David, contain two 
major songs: one in the middle, immediately after their enemy 
has been defeated (Exodus 15; 2 Samuel 1), and one at the very 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
96
end, celebrating the faithfulness of the rock-like God who has 
led them to safety (Deuteronomy 32; 2 Samuel 22).
David’s life is not all desert. Like Israel, he eventually leaves 
his wilderness wanderings and takes hold of the land God has 
given him. Echoes of Joshua’s conquest are all over 2 Samuel: in 
the capture of the apparently impregnable fortress of Jerusalem 
(like Jericho), the kindness and inclusion shown to the wouldbe-enemy Mephibosheth (like Rahab), the hiding of the spies by 
a woman (2 Samuel 17), and the crossing of the Jordan to take 
the city (chap. 19). More tragically, like Achan in Joshua 7, first 
David (with Bathsheba) and then two of his sons (Amnon with 
Tamar, and Absalom with the kingdom) seize things which are 
forbidden, with catastrophic consequences for their families and 
the nation. And worryingly, the story ends with David as the 
Pharaoh-like king who wants to use God’s chosen people for 
his own ends, and Israel as the ones afflicted by a plague by the 
angel of the Lord (2 Samuel 24). The land has been conquered, 
but it is not yet at rest. We are still awaiting a true Joshua.
Perhaps the most significant echo of the exodus story in 
David’s life, however, has nothing to do with battles or plagues, 
enemies or deserts. When we stand back from the excitement 
of the individual incidents and consider the overall sweep of 
the story, David, like Moses, is the prophetic leader who hosts 
God’s presence, draws Israel toward true worship, receives a 
covenant, and prepares a house for the Lord to dwell in. David 
brings the ark to Jerusalem. He desires to build God a house. 
He receives the covenant promise: “I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will 
establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, 
and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be 
to him a father, and he shall be to me a son” (2 Sam. 7:12–14). 
He gets everything ready for the house of God, from musicians 
to money. That, in many ways, is his legacy. It is also the way 
in which he is most like Moses.
All about the House
97
The book of Exodus, for most of us, has an exciting half and 
a boring half: the blood and thunder and escape (Exodus 1–19), 
followed by the law and the preparation of the tabernacle (20–
40). The story of David, likewise, comprises two biblical sections, one of which is vastly more dramatic than the other: the 
tense, intriguing plot of 1 and 2 Samuel, and the more pedestrian 
detail of 1 Chronicles, which largely consists of preparation for 
temple worship. Yet in each case, the authors conclude with the 
focus on the house of God rather than the fights and betrayals. 
Exodus ends with the glory of God filling the tabernacle. Second 
Samuel ends with the purchase of the land on which the temple 
will be built. First Chronicles ends with a financial offering for 
the temple, and David’s prayer of thanksgiving. It is as if the 
authors are saying that David and Moses saw rescue and failure, 
victory and loss. But more than anything else, they had a passion 
for the house of God.
And that is perhaps the most moving way in which King 
David serves as a prelude to King Jesus. We are probably used 
to seeing some of the parallels: David was sung about before he 
was born, anointed by the great prophet of his day, rejected by 
his brothers, triumphant in his fight against the great serpent on 
behalf of the nation, pursued and persecuted by the jealous king, 
repeatedly on the move with his band of not-so-merry men, 
and finally victorious in Jerusalem. Yet David’s life, like Jesus’s, 
was ultimately about the house of God. Picture David: leaving Jerusalem in another personal exodus, crossing the Kidron 
Valley and climbing up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he 
goes yet insisting that the ark of God be returned to the city 
(2 Sam. 15:19–31). He is betrayed by a close confidant, who 
later hangs himself (17:23). He is mocked and cursed, and when 
his friends try to fight for him, he rebukes them and takes the 
curses upon himself (16:5–14). Even after all this, his focus remains on the house of God: its location, materials, priests, musicians, gatekeepers, treasurers, architectural plans, and finances 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
98
(1 Chronicles 21–29). He is looking forward to the day when 
the kingdom will be fully established, the house of God dedicated, and the temple filled with glory. “Don’t even think about 
leaving,” he essentially tells his son Solomon, “until the temple 
is dedicated and the glory has come. It’s all about the house.”
Or, as Jesus will later put it, “Stay in the city until you are 
clothed with power from on high” (Luke 24:49). Don’t even 
think about leaving until the temple is dedicated and the glory 
has come, complete with rushing wind and fiery tongues. It’s all 
about the house.

The End of the Exodus?
1 Kings 6–13
One question we have not explored yet, but which is worth 
asking, is this: When did the exodus from Egypt finish? On the 
night of Passover? When the Israelites had crossed the Red Sea? 
When they received the law? At the death of Moses? After the 
crossing of the Jordan or the fall of Jericho? At the death of 
Joshua? When David became king? Never?
One answer suggests that the exodus ends much later than 
we usually think: “In the four hundred and eightieth year after 
the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth 
year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which 
is the second month, he began to build the house of the Lord” 
(1 Kings 6:1).1
 Three things strike us. First, the construction of 
Solomon’s temple is dated from the exodus. Second, it starts exactly twelve generations (480 = 12 x 40) after Israel left Egypt. 
Third, when we add the time taken to build the temple (seven 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
100
years) and the king’s palace (thirteen years), it is exactly five hundred years from the Passover to the day Solomon blesses God 
for keeping his promise to Israel: “Blessed be the Lord who has 
given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which 
he spoke by Moses his servant” (1 Kings 8:56). The building of 
the temple, the dwelling place of God, somehow completes the 
exodus. The dream that had gripped the Israelites as they fled 
Egypt that night, with bowls of dough on their shoulders and 
anxious children in tow—the dream of being secure, prosperous, 
at peace, ruled by a wise king, and with a permanent house in 
which God’s glory lives forever—has finally been realized.
It is hard for us to grasp the significance of the temple. Israel 
did not see it mainly as a structure, or even as a place to go and 
offer sacrifice; they saw it as the place where God came down to 
meet them, the meeting point of heaven and earth. That’s why 
first the tabernacle, and then (more spectacularly) the temple, 
were filled with reminders of Eden, the place where God walked 
with humans.2
 In fact, the whole thing was built to suggest a 
fruitful, verdant, and well-watered garden.
A walk through the temple would reveal images of pomegranates, open flowers, palm trees, lilies, cedars, and olive wood. 
There were basins of water sitting on bronze stands with chariot 
wheels (which would have also reminded worshipers of the time 
they walked between walls of water, chased by chariot-riding 
Egyptians). There were two guarding cherubim in the inner 
room, images of cherubim on the walls and at the doors, and 
two huge bronze pillars guarding the entrance to the temple, all 
of which echo the cherubim set up as sentries at the entrance to 
the garden of Eden. The temple is even described as having a 
face, ribs, and shoulders (1 Kings 6:3, 5, 8; 7:39), which guide 
our minds back to the way Eve was “built” from Adam’s rib in 
the garden. The temple is an architectural symbol of the bride 
that Solomon brings to the Lord. It is also, like Eden, a sanctu-
The End of the Exodus?
101
ary where God would be especially present, and into which the 
riches of the nations would come—a pattern that begins almost 
immediately with the visit of the Queen of Sheba.
If only we could stop the story at 1 Kings 8. The temple is 
built and dedicated. The glory has come. Israel is settled, rich, 
peaceful, and happy. All the promises have come to pass. And 
they all lived happily ever after.
Except that they didn’t, and those of us who have read exodus stories before will already know why. Solomon, like Adam 
and Israel before him, falls, and in doing so switches from 
being the heroic Joshua of this exodus story into being its tragic 
Pharaoh. He starts by marrying Pharaoh’s daughter (1 Kings 
9:16). Then he uses forced labor to complete building projects, 
like Pharaoh, and builds store cities, like Pharaoh (9:15–19). 
Then he builds a fleet and stations it on the Red Sea (9:26). 
He amasses horses from Egypt, chariots from Egypt, and gold 
(10:14–29). He worships false gods, building high places for 
idolatrous sacrifice (11:1–8). In an extraordinary echo of Exodus 1–2, Solomon even ends up opposed by a young man from 
another nation who was nearly killed at birth, but escaped to 
Egypt, ended up joining Pharaoh’s family, asked for permission 
to leave, and then became an adversary (11:14–22). Solomon 
tries to kill the man he has placed in charge of the forced labor, 
Jeroboam, who flees to—you’ve guessed it—Egypt (11:26–40). 
By the time Solomon’s son takes over the throne, the people are 
referring to Solomon as a king who “made our yoke heavy” 
and “disciplined . . . with whips” (12:10–11). The son of David 
has become the scourge of Israel. The seed of the woman has 
become the dragon.
Worse is to come. As an act of judgment on Solomon, God 
splits the kingdom into two: the southern two tribes under his 
son Rehoboam, and the northern ten tribes under Jeroboam. If 
we had any hope that this might put a stop to Israel’s descent 
into idolatry, it is immediately dashed; Jeroboam becomes the 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
102
new Aaron, setting up worship of not just one but two golden 
calves, and declaring, “Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought 
you up out of the land of Egypt” (1 Kings 12:28). He sets up 
a new priesthood for idolatrous worship, and even names his 
sons Nadab and Abijah (14:1, 20), just as Aaron named his 
boys Nadab and Abihu. Rehoboam fares no better; he is continuously at war with the northern tribes, and the king of (once 
again) Egypt comes up against him and plunders the temple. In 
the space of a few years, exodus triumph has become wilderness 
rebellion.
Yet the God of the exodus is still there. He remembers his 
covenant. And into this chaotic disintegration, this calamitous 
mess, he speaks. He raises up a man of God, a mini-Moses, to 
judge Jeroboam and promise the eventual destruction of idolatrous worship (1 Kings 13). This prophet from Judah, whose 
name we do not even know, confronts the king (as Moses did), 
confirms his word with a miraculous sign of judgment against 
him (as Moses did), sees the altar split (as the tablets of stone 
were split), and sees its ashes poured out (as the golden calf 
was ground to powder and poured out). More ominously, this 
prophet even gets distracted on his journey, disobeys God, and 
dies before he reaches his destination (as Moses did). But before 
he does, he speaks a word of judgment, which is also a word 
of promise: “O altar, altar, thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, a son 
shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he 
shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make 
offerings on you’” (13:2). Like Moses, this man of God can see 
a future in which God will once again act to deliver the nation 
by raising up a leader who will abandon foreign gods and unite 
the nation. It will take a while, though. Israel had to wait forty 
years for Joshua. She will have to wait nearly three hundred 
years for Josiah.
Six hundred years after Josiah, another prophet from Judah 
will come to Israel. He will confront the nation’s rulers and 
The End of the Exodus?
103
speak judgment against their acts of worship, confirming his 
words with miraculous signs. He will turn over the temple tables, temporarily bringing the sacrificial system to a standstill, 
and denounce those who run it as a gang of robbers. He will 
also be ignored, killed, and buried in another man’s grave. Like 
Jeroboam, Jerusalem’s leaders will simply put all the tables back 
and carry on as normal, and as the man from Judah is killed by 
a lion, so the Lion of Judah will be killed by men.
What happens in death, however, makes all the difference. When Josiah finally fulfills this prophecy and destroys 
Jeroboam’s altar, he finds the tomb of the prophet from Judah 
and insists that nobody move his bones (2 Kings 23:18). When 
they found the tomb of the prophet from Judea, on the other 
hand, there were no bones left to move.

Elijah and Elisha
1 Kings 16–2 Kings 13
The divided kingdom lasted three hundred and fifty years, a 
largely idolatrous roller coaster of (one or two) ups and (an 
awful lot of) downs, and the subject of most of 1 and 2 Kings. 
Yet for all the major events he has to cover in that time—the split 
under Rehoboam, the exile of the northern kingdom into Assyria, the restoration of the temple under Josiah, and especially 
the exile of the southern kingdom into Babylon—the author 
gives over half of his narrative to the period spanned by just 
two men: Elijah and Elisha. Clearly, this prophetic double act is 
hugely important. Why?
At first glance, we might think this was simply because their 
lives include so many dramatic stories. These nineteen chapters 
contain countless tales of droughts and downpours, earthquakes 
and hurricanes and still small voices, murders and battles, river 
crossings and optical illusions, fires and chariots and fiery 
Elijah and Elisha
105
chariots, whirlwinds and bears, oil and flour, axes and stews, 
sieges and famines, plots and assassinations, the healing of lepers, and the raising of the dead. But while this is true, it ignores 
the fact that the writer of 1 and 2 Kings doesn’t seem to mind 
tedious lists—the continual cycle of kings falling into idolatry is 
repetitive and boring (partly because idolatry itself is repetitive 
and boring)—and it also avoids the question of why so many 
miracles and dramatic events happened through these two men. 
A better answer, which explains both the concentration of miracles and the focus of the writer, is that we have another exodus 
on our hands. Elijah is a new Moses. Elisha is a new Joshua.
It starts, as exoduses usually do, with the people of God 
suffering under the leadership of a Pharaoh-like figure. In this 
case, the part of Pharaoh is played by four kings and a queen: 
the Omride dynasty of Omri, Ahab and his wife Jezebel, and 
their sons Ahaziah and Jehoram. Under their appalling leadership, idolatry runs rife, Jericho is rebuilt, the righteous are oppressed, and Canaanite pagan worship is reinstated. Drought 
and famine strike the land. People are killed for prophesying. 
Naboth is falsely accused and then murdered simply for owning land that the king wanted to steal. Ahab in particular, we 
are told, “did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, 
to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him” 
(1 Kings 16:33), which, given the company he is in, is really 
saying something. The stage is set for another battle of the 
gods.
Up steps Elijah. The drought that he brings to the land, like 
the plagues Moses and Aaron bring upon Egypt, does not represent punishment as much as it demonstrates that the Lord 
is the true God and Baal is not. In this sense it functions like 
a three-year-long, national-scale version of the showdown at 
Mount Carmel. Baal and Asherah, the gods of Ahab and Jezebel, are supposed to be able to bring rain and fertility. But they 
are exposed as completely impotent; they cannot make a single 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
106
drop of water fall, any more than they can bring fire out of 
the sky (which is why Elijah stopping the rain is the Canaanite 
equivalent of Aaron turning the river Nile to blood or Moses 
darkening the sun). Having brought the “plague” of drought, 
Elijah immediately leaves the land, heads east across the River 
Jordan, finds water in a dry place, and has bread and meat miraculously provided from the skies by ravens, before blessing a 
foreigner with both food and life. The echoes of the exodus are 
unmistakable.
The next two chapters unfold on two mountains, which 
evoke different aspects of Israel’s encounters at Sinai. Mount 
Carmel, famously, is a mountain of confrontation, where Israel 
is confronted with the challenge to worship God alone, an altar 
is established, the living God descends in fire, idols are exposed 
as frauds, idol worshipers are killed, the people acknowledge 
the true God, and a meal is eaten.1
 Mount Horeb, by contrast, 
is a mountain of comfort: a place where Elijah, desiring to die 
and not having eaten for forty days and forty nights, is reassured 
by a direct encounter with the divine presence, and leaves with 
fresh impetus and faith to lead the nation. In the story of the 
great exodus, Mount Sinai—which, we should remember, is also 
called Mount Horeb—was both of these things at once, a place 
of judgment and blessing, confrontation and comfort. There 
may even be exodus significance in the fact that, sandwiched 
between these two mountain encounters, we have a story about 
a thick cloud descending, a king on a chariot (Ahab/Pharaoh) 
racing to escape stormy waters, and the man of God (Elijah/
Moses) going ahead of him, carried by the hand of the Lord. 
Eventually Ahab, like Pharaoh, will die in his chariot, which will 
end up underwater (1 Kings 22:38).
It is at this point in each story that we first meet the prophetic 
successors, Joshua and Elisha. Both men have similar names, 
which highlight the rescue God will work through them: Joshua
means “the Lord Saves,” and Elisha means “God Saves.” Both 
Elijah and Elisha
107
men will serve older leaders for some time, before being commissioned on the far side of the Jordan. Both will begin their 
leadership with a miraculous river crossing, in imitation of their 
mentors. Both will immediately face unanswered questions 
about the location of their predecessors’ bodies. Both are called 
to take the land of Israel for the Lord, beginning in Jericho. 
Both will show unusual kindness to a person from an enemy 
nation (Rahab the Canaanite prostitute and Naaman the Syrian 
leper), bring judgment to Israelites who steal things (Achan and 
Gehazi), and conquer foreign armies in miraculous ways.
Perhaps the strangest thing that Moses and Joshua have in 
common with Elijah and Elisha, however, is that their exoduses 
never quite finish. Moses led Israel out of Egypt but died outside 
the land. Joshua led Israel into the Promised Land, but his campaign against idolatry and sin and his conquest of the land were 
left incomplete. Elijah and Elisha confronted and destroyed the 
Pharaoh-like Omride dynasty, with a bit of help from Jehu and 
the king of Syria, but Israel quickly tumbled back into idolatry 
and wickedness and was eventually deported a hundred years 
later. For all the miraculous provision of food and water, healing and life, their ultimate aim—the restoration of Israel—was 
never achieved.
That had to wait for another pair of prophets. The first, like 
Moses and Elijah, was a man of the wilderness, crying out for repentance and confronting the nation’s wicked ruler. The second, 
like Joshua and Elisha, was commissioned at the Jordan, worked 
wonders, welcomed prostitutes and enemy soldiers, healed lepers, provided miraculous food for people, pronounced judgment 
on rebellious cities, and raised the dead to life. Like Joshua and 
Elisha, he carried salvation in his very name: Yeshua, or “the 
Lord Saves.” Yet unlike them, he was able to bring about the 
great deliverance that Israel truly needed. “You shall call his 
name Jesus,” the angel had told Joseph, “for he will save his 
people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21).

The Outstretched Arm
Isaiah–Malachi
People remember military victories in three main ways, although in the modern world we tend to express only two of 
them. The first is in celebration, or even nostalgia: we won, 
they lost, we’re great, they’re not, yah-boo-sucks. Trivial or not, 
this is the kind of memory reflected in Shakespeare’s Henry V, 
Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture, the Arc de Triomphe and Trafalgar Square, Independence Day fireworks, and “The StarSpangled Banner.” The second is in regret or lament: yes, we 
prevailed, but the costs were so terrible that we must never, ever 
allow that to happen again. This is remembrance through memorial walls, poppies, “Anthem for Doomed Youth,” “lest we 
forget,” war cemeteries, and moments of silence. Both of these 
involve looking back, whether to learn lessons, honor sacrifice, 
or treasure national triumphs.
But there’s a third way of remembering victory, and it’s the 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
110
way Israel reflects on the exodus from Egypt. As judgment falls 
on the nation for idolatry, with the northern and southern kingdoms imploding and exile approaching, the prophets keep calling Israel to remember the exodus—but not in nostalgia for a 
past golden age and certainly not in lament for tragedy, but in 
hope for the future. Israel worships the God of the exodus: the 
God who may appear silent but who hears the cry of his people, 
and who is quietly preparing to liberate them from captivity 
with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. So when all seems 
lost, there is hope. The God of the exodus lives. He will redeem 
them. “It has happened before,” you can imagine Charlton Heston gravely reminding the desperate nation, “and it will happen 
again. The only question is when.”
The so-called minor prophets are continually pointing Israel 
forward by pointing them back, and to the exodus in particular. 
The turning point of Hosea, in which God erupts in love and 
compassion for Israel in spite of their whoredom and idolatry, 
is shot through with exodus imagery: “out of Egypt I called 
my son”; “I bent down to them and fed them”; “it was I who 
taught Ephraim to walk”; “they shall come trembling like birds 
from Egypt, . . . and I will return them to their homes” (Hos. 
11:1–11). Joel celebrates Egypt’s future desolation and Israel’s 
future prosperity. Jonah, who knows a thing or two about the 
exodus-style mercy of God, having just experienced a journey 
into the waters and out again, gets frustrated with the Lord for 
forgiving Nineveh, and as he does so, he uses the very words 
God revealed to Moses on Sinai: “That is why I made haste to 
flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love” (Jon. 4:2).
Micah refers to the same passage, and centers his appeal to Israel 
on the exodus, the leadership of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, 
and the “righteous acts of the Lord” when God’s people were 
threatened by Balak (Mic. 6:3–5; 7:15, 18–19). Habakkuk 3 
is an extended reflection on the exodus. Zechariah promises 
The Outstretched Arm
111
restoration in language that comes straight out of the Red Sea 
crossing (Zech. 10:8–12). It has happened before. It will happen again.
The writings of the major prophets are shaped by the exodus 
too, only at greater length. Jeremiah spends his entire ministry 
warning Judah that they are about to be taken captive into a 
foreign land, where they will need to settle in for the long haul 
and await the deliverance that the Lord will eventually bring. 
This deliverance will be so dramatic that people will no longer 
swear by the God who brought Israel out of Egypt but by the 
God who brought Israel out of exile (Jer. 16:14–15); not only 
that, but the covenant will not be like the exodus one, which 
Israel broke, but a new one in which, God says, “I will put my 
law within them, and I will write it on their hearts” (31:33). 
Daniel, who prophesies from within Babylon, is himself a sort 
of Joseph figure—a wise man who gains influence with the king 
by refusing to compromise morally, interpreting dreams and 
providing good counsel, to the extent that the king ends up 
worshiping Israel’s God—although like Israel, Daniel also sees 
the transition to a new king, who does not know God and who 
will face judgment for his idolatrous ways (Daniel 1–5).
The exodus is even more prominent in the ministry of Ezekiel.1
 Like Moses, he receives a dramatic vision of God in fire, in 
an unexpected place (Ezekiel 1); he goes to speak to the captives 
of his people (3); and he is a Levite prophet, sent to a rebellious 
and idolatrous people with signs and with plagues (4–6), leading 
up to a Passover event (9). Like Moses, he is fundamentally a 
prophet of the divine presence, who sees that God is on the move 
and accompanies his people wherever they go (1; 10; 48). Like 
Moses, he is given instruction for proper worship. The book 
concludes on a high mountain, where Ezekiel is given a law and 
instructions for feasts, and from which he surveys the ordering 
of the temple, the city, and the entire land (40–48). The three 
major sections of his book are exodus-shaped as well. In the first 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
112
part (1–24), as Ezekiel preaches judgment on Israel, the exodus 
story is central to his savage rebuke of the nation’s idolatry (16; 
20; 23). In the second (25–32), as he preaches judgment on 
the surrounding nations, by far the longest section is devoted 
to Egypt and Pharaoh (29–32). And the third section (33–48) 
pivots on an act of grace in which the Lord will take Israel out 
of captivity, cleanse them from idolatry, give them a new heart, 
bring them into their own land, and fill them with his Spirit 
(36–37). The echoes of the exodus here are as loud and clear as 
anywhere else in the Prophets—except, that is, for Isaiah.
Isaiah’s rich and beautiful prophecy contains a dramatic exodus triple-whammy, as he promises first rescue from Assyria, 
then redemption from Babylon, and finally redemption from 
sin itself, in a fashion that echoes the exodus but turns it completely on its head. (If you’ve ever seen pianists cross their hands 
midway through a piece, you know how strange it is to hear the 
same notes being played, as it were, upside down. That, as we 
will see, is what happens in Isaiah 51–55.)
In the first half of Isaiah, the shape of Israel’s deliverance 
is familiar. There is a Pharaoh figure, the king of Assyria, who 
thinks he is stronger than the Lord and is keen to oppress God’s 
people, but who (it turns out) is being used by God to achieve 
his purposes. There is the assurance that God will come down in 
fire, that the Assyrians will be first struck with plagues and then 
wiped out in one day, and that Israel will be rescued, return to 
their land by crossing a river on dry land, and sing the song of 
Exodus 15 on the far side (Isaiah 10–12). There is the promise 
of tragedy upon the unbelieving city and judgment upon the 
dragon that is in the sea, while God’s people are brought back 
from Egypt and ascend his mountain to eat and drink with him 
(24–27). So when we finally meet Sennacherib, king of Assyria, 
we already know what will happen. We find a threat to God’s 
people, trash talk from the enemy, false promises, and desperate 
prayer to the God of heaven’s armies. And then it happens. The 
The Outstretched Arm
113
angel of the Lord goes out, at night, and strikes down the Assyrians by the thousands. The world’s most powerful empire is 
defeated in twelve hours, along with their gods, and Israel wakes 
in the morning to find their salvation has been accomplished 
without their having lifted a finger (36–37). The God of the 
exodus lives. His people are free.
But not for long. Just over a century later, Babylon will play 
the role of Egypt, and Judah will once again be in captivity to 
a foreign power, banished to a foreign land, and surrounded by 
foreign gods. So another exodus is needed, one in which God 
redeems his people from slavery, exposes the impotence of idols, 
releases prisoners from bondage, dries up the rivers and makes 
a way through the sea, provides water to the thirsty from a 
rock in the wilderness, and enables Israel to flee in joy, saying 
“The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob!” (Isa. 48:20; see 
Isaiah 40–48). Babylon and its gods will come to nothing. Israel 
will be free.
But not for long. And this is where Isaiah starts to turn everything on its head, playing the same notes but crossing his hands 
over. Judah’s problem, we discover, is deeper than physical captivity and harder to crack than mere armies. They are captive 
to sin itself: their iniquity, their faithlessness, their tendency to 
revert to idolatry even after they have been rescued again and 
again. In their captivity, they are inclined to think that God has 
forgotten them. Yet as with Israel’s oppression in Egypt, the 
Lord remembers: “Can a woman forget her nursing child, that 
she can have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these 
may forget, yet I will not forget you. Behold, I have engraved 
you on the palms of my hands” (Isa. 49:15–16). With exodus 
imagery pouring forth—“O arm of the Lord; awake. . . . Was it 
not you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon? Was 
it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, 
who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass 
over?” (Isa. 51:9–10)—we anticipate a new act of deliverance, 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
114
not just temporarily from the latest invader, but once and for all 
(49–51).
The arm of the Lord, as we know by now, is about strength, 
power, even violence: the mighty hand and the outstretched arm 
that rain hailstones like fists and split the ocean. So as Isaiah 
begins to celebrate Judah’s redemption, we are not surprised to 
hear that it comes about because “the Lord has bared his holy 
arm before the eyes of all nations,” and that his servant will be 
“high and lifted up” (Isa. 52:10, 13). Here it comes: the violent 
showdown we have all been waiting for. We can hear Wagner’s 
Ride of the Valkyries beginning in the background.
But the orchestra goes silent. Suddenly, the concert hall is 
deathly quiet. No trumpets or horns sound; the strings are muffled, and the oboes have been gently put back on the floor. The 
only sound we can hear is a plaintive cry, and as we peer at the 
stage in astonishment, we notice that it is coming from a manger, 
or the graveside of a friend, or a hillside garden, or even a cross. 
It is the cry of one like a root out of dry ground, with no beauty 
that we should desire him, despised and rejected by men, a man 
of sorrows and acquainted with grief (Isa. 53:2–3). Here, we 
learn, is what the arm of the Lord actually looks like in person: 
one who bears our griefs, carries our sorrows, is pierced for our 
transgressions, and is crushed for our iniquities (53:5). That is 
how Israel will be accounted righteous. That is what causes barren women to burst into song and thirsty travelers from every 
nation to descend on Jerusalem for a free banquet (53–55).
We didn’t think the new exodus would look like that at all. 
We were so busy looking for God in the plagues or chariots 
hurled into the sea that we missed him in the fragile baby drifting downstream in a basket, and in the lamb’s blood smeared 
across the doorpost, and in the two goats who face death and 
exile to take away the sins of the people. The God of the exodus 
is still high and lifted up, and he still redeems with a mighty hand 
and an outstretched arm. But now he is high and lifted up on a 
The Outstretched Arm
115
cross, and his arms are outstretched sideways, and his mighty 
hands have nails in them. Isaiah is as surprised as anyone: “Who 
has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the 
arm of the Lord been revealed?” (Isa. 53:1). Who indeed?

Purim and Purity
Ezra–Esther
In many ways, the last history books of the Old Testament could 
hardly be more different. Ezra-Nehemiah, which in the Hebrew 
Bible was all on one scroll, reads like a detailed—even slightly 
pedantic—national history, complete with lists, names, numbers, official documents, and building projects. It is based in Israel, entirely about men, focused on the worship of God, largely 
humorless (unless you count that bit when Nehemiah matterof-factly says, “I . . . beat some of them and pulled out their 
hair,” Neh. 13:25), and ends in disappointment, as the Israelites 
continue to marry foreign women. Esther, on the other hand, is 
a gripping story of heroism, dramatic irony, clownish villains, 
and poetic justice. It is set in Persia, never specifically mentions 
God, revolves around a beautiful and courageous woman, ends 
in triumph, and reads like a pantomime, with a fair maiden, a 
boorish king, an evil prime minister who gets booed every time 
Purim and Purity
117
he steps on stage, and Mordecai as Buttons, the British pantomime figure. The narrative high point of Ezra-Nehemiah is when 
a wall gets completed. The high point of Esther involves a tense 
nighttime confrontation, an enemy getting hoisted by his own 
petard, and a nation being saved from slaughter. Again: apples 
and oranges.
These very different histories have at least one thing in common, however: they both echo the exodus. Together they tell the 
story of Israel being dramatically freed from foreign oppressors 
and their gods, against all the odds and in the face of fierce opposition, and being released to go and worship the Lord, follow 
his laws, and enter his land. The story of Esther, which chronologically happens first, has more in common with the first half of 
Exodus; Ezra-Nehemiah has more in common with the second. 
Yet each book draws attention to the great deliverance God has 
brought about and the need for Israel to respond in faithfulness.
The book of Esther begins in a way that should be familiar by now. The Israelites are under the rule of a foreign empire (Persia/Egypt). A previous king had shown favor to them 
(Cyrus/Pharaoh), even to the point of giving them their own 
portion of land (Susa/Goshen), partly through the wisdom of 
a young man who had great wisdom in interpreting dreams 
(Daniel/Joseph). But now we hear that a new king is on the 
throne (Xerxes/Pharaoh), and he is an ungodly and arrogant 
fool. Then, in Esther 2, we meet the one through whom God will 
rescue his people (Esther/Moses): a young person of beauty, who 
through the wisdom of her relative (Mordecai/Miriam) ends up 
being brought into the king’s family. We have been here before.
The next chapter introduces us to the serpent figure, Haman, 
who is an Agagite. This in itself tells us something: the Agagites 
were descended from Agag the Amalekite, the king whom Saul 
had been commanded to destroy (1 Samuel 15), because the 
Amalekites had opposed Israel as they fled from Egypt. From 
an Israelite perspective, to be an Agagite is to be an enemy. So 
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
118
we are not surprised when Haman reacts with fury to Mordecai and seeks to destroy all the Jews. This move, from jealousy 
to hatred to attempted genocide, began with Pharaoh, but has 
tragically played itself out repeatedly in history, from Haman 
to Herod to Hitler.
Having said that, if we read the story through an exodus 
lens, we do not merely know that there will be an attempt to 
oppress and destroy Israel; we also know that the attempt will 
fail. What is more, we know how it will fail. It will involve the 
serpent being deceived by the shrewdness of the righteous (repeatedly, in fact, as in a farcical turn of events Haman ends up 
publicly honoring his enemy Mordecai, and then being tricked 
and outmaneuvered by the queen). It will include the poetic justice of seeing Israel’s enemy having the tables turned on him, in 
this case hanging on the gallows he had intended for the Jews, 
much as Egypt had drowned in the sea after trying to drown 
the Israelite boys. The turning point will be a nighttime meal, 
in which the judgment of death—which was decreed on the 
day before Passover (Est. 3:12)—will pass from Israel to their 
enemies (7:1–10). Israel will end up with spoil from the very 
enemies who were trying to kill them (9:1–10) and security in 
the land. The whole episode will be commemorated with a feast 
and a holiday from that day forward (9:23–38). Echoes of the 
exodus are everywhere.
One more aspect of the Esther story is worth noticing, although it is one that has more to do with a future exodus than a 
past one. On hearing the decree, given just before Passover, that 
her people are about to be destroyed, Esther calls the Jews to 
fast for three days and nights (Est. 4:16). Following this period 
of prayer, she will approach the king to see if he will extend his 
scepter toward her and grant her request; as she points out to 
Mordecai, she is as good as dead if he doesn’t (4:11). On the 
third day, she finds favor in the king’s sight and is raised up, 
as if from death, and given whatever she asks for (5:1–3). She 
Purim and Purity
119
asks for the deliverance of her people. That marvelous cycle of 
prayer, death, third-day resurrection, and the redemption of a 
people, as we know, will be back.
Most of the events of Ezra-Nehemiah take place a generation later, and their echoes of the exodus are somewhat different. Both Ezra and Nehemiah begin with stories about Israelites 
being given permission by the Persian king to return to their 
land, so in a sense we are beginning the exodus story halfway 
through (although note that both Cyrus and Artaxerxes give 
permission more readily than Pharaoh!).1
 In Ezra, we hear about 
offerings being taken for the temple, including contributions 
from Gentiles, a numbering of the people, the reestablishment of 
Mosaic worship, the completion of the temple, and the celebration of the Passover. Nehemiah, likewise, focuses on a building 
project—in this case the walls of Jerusalem—and the obligations 
of the Mosaic covenant, including a climactic celebration of the 
Feast of Tabernacles, as Israel did in the wilderness. Both books, 
in that sense, tell the same story as the second half of Exodus 
and the book of Numbers.
Ezra and Nehemiah are also filled with stories of opposition, which remind us of Israel’s wandering in the wilderness. 
Sometimes this opposition comes from within God’s people, 
through covenant faithlessness and banned sexual relationships. Sometimes it comes from outside it, as the people of 
the land do their best to scupper Israel’s chances. Most of us, 
if we’re honest, find neither Numbers nor Ezra-Nehemiah the 
easiest parts of Scripture to read, but the light they shed on 
the journey of God’s people is remarkable: alongside the obvious difficulties of persecution and confrontation (whether 
from Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, or whomever), we all 
face the more subtle challenges of disillusionment, immorality, 
idolatry, and fear. Scripture and history are full of people who 
could withstand an army, but crumbled in the face of sexual 
temptation or a golden calf.2
Third Movement: The Reechoing of Exodus
120
In response to this opposition, Ezra serves as a new Moses. 
He is committed to studying, observing, and teaching the law, 
he urges Israel to keep God’s covenant, and he prays for them 
to be forgiven when they don’t. Nehemiah, whose account of 
the exodus story is one of the longest in the whole Bible (Nehemiah 9), might remind us of Phinehas, whose zeal for the law 
led to drastic action when he saw God’s people compromising with foreign women (though the fact that Nehemiah “beat 
some of them and pulled out their hair” looks rather mild in 
comparison to spearing a couple while they are having sex!). 
Yet Ezra-Nehemiah ends in disappointment. Israel is in the land 
geographically, but the promises of inheritance, renewal, and 
blessing have not come to pass. It is as if this exodus story ends 
where Deuteronomy finished, with the death of Moses, a song 
of warning, and the Israelites stranded on the plains of Moab.
This is no accident. As the history of the Old Testament 
draws to a close, we are still waiting for a new Joshua, who will 
lead Israel into the fullness of their inheritance, cleanse their 
land, and conquer their enemies. Only then will Israel’s exile be 
truly over, their return to the land complete, and their exodus 
fully accomplished.

DELIVERANCE

The Crescendo
Matthew–John
The life of Jesus is an exodus, hidden in plain sight.
It starts with the nativity. The homespun charm of the Christmas story and the sentimentality with which we often celebrate 
it can obscure the exodus music that reverberates through it, 
even for those who know the story well. Matthew and Luke do 
their utmost to help us hear it, though. At times, the familiar 
rhythms and melodies become almost deafening.
Take an example that most of us miss: the names of the 
characters. We know this is an exodus story as soon as we are 
introduced to the cast. We have a Joseph, a faithful Israelite who 
has dreams and receives promises of God’s miraculous redemption to come. We have an Elisheba (Elizabeth), the wife of the 
priest from the family of Aaron (Ex. 6:23). We have a Miriam 
(Mary), the courageous woman who becomes a mother to God’s 
people by protecting the promised rescuer in childhood, and 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
126
who sings prophetically of God’s mighty act of deliverance. We 
have a Hannah (Anna), the faithful woman who prays in the 
temple for the redemption of Israel, recognizes the miracle child 
as God’s answer, and proclaims it to the world. We have men 
whose names witness to the fact that God hears the cry of his 
people and remembers them: Zacharias (“the Lord Remembers”) and Simeon (“Heard”). And we have the one for whom 
the whole nation has been waiting: a Joshua (Jesus).
The exodus and nativity stories are, in outline, remarkably 
similar. We start with Israel being oppressed by a foreign power, 
women of faithfulness and bravery, the birth of a male child, and 
an evil king intent on destroying him by killing baby boys. We 
have an angelic appearance to a shepherd or shepherds, with the 
promise of a “sign” that will demonstrate that God’s word has 
been fulfilled. Signs appear in the night sky. Gentiles give gifts 
and come to worship Israel’s God. The chosen people escape in 
response to a nighttime angelic encounter, before waiting and 
then reentering the land. The striking difference is that while 
Israel escapes from Egypt into the land, Jesus escapes from the 
land into Egypt. But as Matthew points out, Jesus is identifying 
with Israel in his journey into Egypt and then out again; the 
prophecies of both Hosea and Jeremiah, originally given about 
Israel’s departure and return, now apply to Jesus as the new 
Israel.1
 The Israel musical theme is being taken up and incorporated into the Jesus theme.
Intriguingly, even the Gospels without a nativity story draw 
our attention to the exodus as they introduce Jesus. For John, 
the birth of Jesus is the moment when “the Word became flesh 
and dwelt [or tabernacled] among us,” revealing the glory of 
God which nobody has ever seen and bringing a fresh revelation 
of grace and truth on top of that which came through Moses 
(1:14–18). The echoes of Exodus 32–34 could hardly be clearer. 
For Mark, John the Baptist is like the angel of the Lord who goes 
before Israel. “Behold, I send my messenger before your face” 
The Crescendo
127
(Mark 1:2) is very close to Exodus 23:20, which indicates both 
that God’s forerunner (John/the angel) is preparing the way for 
his chosen one (Jesus/Israel) and that the journey ahead will be 
perilous, filled with opposition, and in need of angelic protection. As Mark bombards us with stories of casting out demons 
and sicknesses and cleansing the land from hostile powers who 
know Jesus has come to destroy them, we remember the way the 
Canaanites responded to Israel on hearing they were coming.2
So when Jesus’s public ministry begins, we are expecting to 
hear about a forty-day (or year) time of testing in the wilderness and a crossing of the River Jordan. Jesus, like Israel, goes 
through the waters of baptism. He is given a physical representation of the Holy Spirit’s presence with him—the dove reminds us 
both of Noah and of the Spirit hovering over the waters in creation—and he hears a voice from heaven announcing his identity and calling for the nation to listen. His baptism marks the 
transfer of leadership from John to Jesus, as it did from Moses 
to Joshua and from Elijah to Elisha; as he comes up out of the 
Jordan, he emerges with a new commission to move through the 
land and drive out the powers of darkness.
At the same time, like Israel, Jesus has a lengthy period of 
wandering in the desert. The Spirit leads him into a dry and 
barren place, in which he has to trust God for the provision of 
bread, resist evil, and stand on the testimony of Scripture. The 
specific temptations echo those that unraveled Israel: grumbling 
about the lack of food, testing God by demanding a miracle, 
bowing down to false gods, and seizing his inheritance before 
it was time. (It is no coincidence that in all three of his temptations Jesus quotes Deuteronomy, the sermon Moses preached 
to remind Israel of their need for obedience.) But Jesus succeeds 
where Israel failed. For all our familiarities with the exodus 
story in Scripture, we have never seen this before. The all-toofamiliar biblical melody of failure has been transformed and 
turned into a song of hope.
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
128
When Jesus returns from the wilderness in Matthew, he calls 
disciples, much as Moses set up elders of the people in Exodus 18. He is followed by multitudes, goes up a mountain, and 
teaches people from it, much as Moses did. His teaching explores what it means to obey the law, just like Moses’s did, although unlike Moses he teaches on his own authority and insists 
on a greater level of righteousness than was achievable through 
the law. Jesus identifies the people as “sheep without a shepherd” (Matt. 9:36) and immediately appoints leaders who will 
help them, just as Moses did with Joshua.3
 He sets apart twelve 
individuals and sends them into the land, as if to “spy it out” for 
the conquest of the gospel, just as Moses did. Those that receive 
these men will receive blessing—just as Rahab did—but those 
that reject them will face destruction, just as Ai did. Later on 
Jesus expands the group of leaders to seventy, just as Moses did.
Jesus identifies himself as the one who has not come to 
bring peace but a sword (Matt. 10:34), which suggests that in 
the person of Jesus, Joshua and the “commander of the Lord’s
army” have become one and the same (see Josh. 5:14).4
 He announces that the walls of the temple will come crashing down 
when the trumpets announce his coming, just as the walls of 
Jericho crumbled. Even his final words in Matthew, the socalled Great Commission, reflect God’s commission to Joshua: 
I have given you everywhere you put your feet, to the very ends 
of the land. You are to obey whatever I commanded you. And 
I will be with you always.
The extent of all these exodus parallels—or, to return to 
our musical analogy, the volume at which the exodus theme is 
transposed, amplified, and turned into the Jesus theme—indicates that we are entering the final movement. As we have seen 
throughout this book, exodus echoes are everywhere, and they 
recapitulate and reinforce each other. In the person of Jesus, 
however, things are building toward a climax. The whole orchestra has been brought in. Choirs have been added. The music 
The Crescendo
129
of the previous movements, from Abraham to Moses to Elijah 
and Elisha, is being drawn together into one magnificent harmony in a way that neglects none of them and transcends all of 
them. Listening for this helps us see not just what the exodus is 
about, but what the gospel of the kingdom is about.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the Gospel of John, which 
brings the exodus theme to a crescendo. Jesus is the provider 
of wine for God’s people so they can celebrate with him, behold him, and eat and drink (John 2; cf. Exodus 24). He is 
the preacher of the new birth, through the waters and by the 
Spirit, and the bronze serpent lifted up in the wilderness, that 
whoever believes may have life (3). He is the fountain of water 
in dry places (4; 7). He heals those who have been weak and 
paralyzed, hopeless and lost—one man for thirty-eight years—
and gives them rest (5; cf. Deut. 2:14). He provides the bread 
of heaven and reveals his sovereignty over the waters (6). He 
is the prophet like Moses and the source of true spiritual food 
and drink (6; 7). He is the light that leads Israel, the truth that 
liberates them from slavery, and the “I am” of the burning bush 
(8). He is the shepherd who leads his people out and protects 
them (10). He turns Pharaoh’s plagues on their heads, bringing 
fresh water to the thirsty, healing to those plagued with sickness, 
light in the darkness, and life to the dead, ultimately through 
his self-sacrifice as the King’s firstborn Son at Passover. He is 
the true tabernacle, in whom we see what God truly looks like; 
the true mediator, who prays that his people would be united in 
truth and holiness; the true Lamb of God, who takes away the 
sin of the world.
Come, let us adore him.

The Exodus of Jesus
Matthew–John
After numerous chapters of hint and suggestion, allusion and 
parallel, Luke finally gives it to us straight: Jesus is going to 
have an exodus of his own. This truth comes out on the Mount 
of Transfiguration: “And behold, two men were talking with 
him, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of his 
exodos, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem” (Luke 
9:30–31). Translate that word how you will—departure, exit, 
decease, death, exodus—but in New Testament times exodos
was the word used to describe Israel’s exodus from Egypt. And 
here we have Jesus talking—to Moses and Elijah no less—about 
how he is going to accomplish one in Jerusalem.
The exodus music in the Gospels has been building for a 
while, but as the transfiguration approaches, it becomes unmistakable. Jesus and the disciples have been working miracles, 
which have caught the attention of the Pharaoh-like Herod—
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
132
who, like Joseph’s Pharaoh in Genesis 40:20–22, had just celebrated his birthday with an execution.1
 Jesus departs, crossing 
the sea, and heads out into the wilderness. He is followed by 
a multitude of Israelites who have no food, so Jesus delegates 
authority to his disciples (as did Moses), gets them arranged in 
groups of fifty (as did Moses), and provides heavenly bread for 
all of them (as did Moses). The parallels extend to the oddest of 
details, like the fact that only the men are numbered, and that 
there are twelve baskets of food left over. One for each tribe, 
presumably.
Eight days later—and frequently in Scripture, the eighth 
day is the day of new creation—Jesus goes up the mountain 
to pray, accompanied by Peter, James, and John, just as Moses 
had gone up Mount Sinai with Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu. The 
disciples see a theophany, an appearance of God, as the glory 
cloud descends. Central to the appearance is the transfiguration 
of Jesus’s face, which is a fascinating detail since the “face” of 
God is precisely the part of him that Moses was not allowed to 
see. This, clearly, is a greater kind of theophany. Moses appears, 
along with Elijah, and Jesus talks with them about his exodos. 
Peter, worried that Moses and Elijah are about to leave, asks to 
prepare tents for everybody. If we have followed the story so far, 
we will roll our eyes at Peter here (“not knowing what he said,” 
Luke 9:33), because we understand that Moses and Elijah, representing the Law and the Prophets, were always supposed to 
make way for the glory of Jesus, like John the Baptist becoming 
less so that Jesus might become greater. We will also notice the 
reference to tents (or tabernacles).
A voice from heaven is heard, proclaiming the identity of 
God’s chosen One and urging people to listen to him, just as the 
Lord’s descent on Mount Sinai validated the teaching of Moses 
through the law. Both Jesus and Moses encounter a multitude 
after coming down from the mountain, as well as representatives 
who have proved faithless in their task during their absence. The 
The Exodus of Jesus
133
disciples have been unable to restrain a demon, who throws a 
boy down and “shatters him” (Luke 9:39), just as Aaron was 
unable to restrain demon worshipers, causing Moses to throw 
the tablets down and shatter them. Jesus rebukes the people 
fiercely: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to 
be with you and bear with you?” (9:41). This, like so much of 
the passage, reminds us of the way Moses spoke about Israel 
in the wilderness: “They are a perverse generation, children in 
whom is no faithfulness” (Deut. 32:20).
All of this indicates that the exodos of Jesus is not just about 
his death, as the word departure might suggest, but about his 
glory, authority, revelation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. Jesus is not just leaving. He is starting an exodus: a 
long-awaited escape from the land of slavery into a new world 
flowing with milk and honey, in which the slave masters are 
thrown down and drowned in the sea, but the multitude of faith, 
both Jew and Gentile, find freedom.
The escape theme comes through in some surprising ways. In 
his final few days, Jesus tells various stories about being ready 
and watchful because a nighttime flight is approaching rapidly. 
In Luke 17, as he is describing the coming of the Son of Man, he 
uses two exodus stories to encourage faith and warn about the 
consequences of turning back. The “days” of the Son of Man 
will be just like the “days” of Noah, when the enemies of God 
were drowned in water, and the “days” of Lot, when plagues 
from the sky brought destruction on a wicked city. Understandably, when telling the exodus story, we prefer to focus on what 
happened to Israel rather than what happened to Egypt, on 
Noah rather than the sons of Cain, on Lot rather than Sodom. 
But Jesus urged his disciples to learn from both—to resolve, as 
the old song has it, “to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning 
back.” Israel looked back, and they lost their inheritance. Lot’s 
wife turned back, and she turned into a pillar of salt.
The model of resilience, of a steadfast commitment to leave 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
134
slavery behind and press on toward the promised inheritance, 
is Jesus himself. On the night he is betrayed, he enacts a miniexodus of his own. After a Passover meal, at night, he leaves the 
city that is about to face judgment, followed by the Twelve (who 
represent the twelve tribes of Israel), crosses the river, and heads 
for the mountain where he meets with God, accompanied by 
angels. In doing so, Jesus also echoes the exodus of David after 
Absalom’s coup: betrayed by a close friend and advisor (Judas, 
like Ahithophel), leaving Jerusalem and weeping, climbing the 
Mount of Olives, ministered to by a messenger (angels, like Ziba), 
assaulted with violence and cursing by enemies (soldiers, like Shimei), and with a right-hand man who wishes to strike them down 
(Peter, like Abishai), which he prevents.2
 Perhaps the most astonishing echo of the exodus in the betrayal story, and certainly the 
most puzzling for the people who experienced it, is the moment 
when Jesus says, “I am,” and the soldiers draw back and fall to 
the ground (John 18:6). Jesus is Moses and Israel and David—but 
he is also the Lord, the God of the burning bush, in human form.
Not to mention that Jesus is the Passover Lamb. As each Gospel has emphasized in its own way, Jesus is pure and spotless, 
without blemish or fault. He offers himself over the Passover 
weekend. His death is a sacrifice that will ransom his people 
and substitute for the nation. The crucial meal involves his body 
being eaten by his followers. Not one of his bones is broken. 
Darkness covers the skies in the middle of the day, and then he 
dies. As he does so, his blood redeems first Jews, some of whom 
literally come out of their graves then and there, and then an 
untold multitude of Gentiles who join God’s people in fleeing 
the slavery of sin and death—previously guilty criminals who, 
like Barabbas, started the day in prison expecting execution, and 
ended it with the jail doors wide open because an innocent One 
had become their substitute. Israel sacrificed a Passover lamb so 
as not have to sacrifice their firstborn sons. God, who is rich in 
mercy, sacrificed both.
The Exodus of Jesus
135
The exodus of Israel did not finish in one night, as we know. 
Freedom, as Moses explained to Pharaoh, was three days’ journey 
away, and was ultimately seen not in the escape at night, but as 
dawn broke in the morning and God’s people saw their enemies 
lying vanquished in the deep. In the same way, it is at dawn on the 
third day, as the sun (and the Son) rises, that the tears of mourning 
turn to joy, and the temporary escape becomes a permanent deliverance, and the dragon is crushed, never to enslave again. “Why 
do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has 
risen!” (Luke 24:5–6). Fittingly, it is once again Mary, or Miriam, 
who leads the women in celebration of the exodos.
The gospel story ends, if it ends at all, on a mountain. In 
Matthew it is a Joshua-like mountain, as Jesus commissions his 
followers to teach his commandments to all generations and 
go in to inherit the land he has secured for them, in confident 
knowledge of his presence. In Luke-Acts it is more of a Moseslike mountain, involving an ascension, a cloud, angels, shining 
clothes, and the instruction to wait for the Holy Spirit to fill his 
temple. Both of these Gospel writers, like the makers of The 
Prince of Egypt, conclude their exodus narratives on mountaintops, and you can see why: the encounter with the Lord at Sinai 
is, in many ways, the climactic moment to which the rest of the 
story has been pointing. When we think of Jesus’s ascension 
into heaven, when he is finally “lifted up from the earth” (John 
12:32), seated at the right hand of the Father, and begins to draw 
all men to himself, we could say the same.
Yet even so, in all four Gospels, the story remains unfinished. 
The kingdom is not yet fully here. The Land has not yet been 
taken. The Spirit has not yet come. The exodus of Jesus may be 
over, but the exodus of his people has only just started.

Sinai and Pentecost
Acts
What goes up must come down. The earthly ministry of Jesus 
culminates in his going up: up to Jerusalem, up to Skull Hill, 
up onto the cross, up from death to life, up to the Mount of 
Olives, and finally up into heaven. But the story of the gospel, 
Luke explains, is only what Jesus began to do and teach (Acts 
1:1). The next part of his activity on earth, which Luke focuses 
on in Acts, will take place through the church, and it involves 
a coming down.
The gift of the Spirit at Pentecost is often associated with 
Babel, and with good reason. People are not scattering; God 
comes down and works a miracle of language; people scatter 
throughout the world; and the fulfillment of God’s promise to 
Abraham begins. At Babel, this scattering was an act of judgment in response to disobedience, bringing incomprehension 
and fracture. At Pentecost, it is an act of blessing in response to 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
138
obedience, bringing new understanding and unity. Pentecost, in 
an important sense, is Babel’s reversal.
Yet Pentecost also echoes the exodus, and particularly the 
encounter on the mountain at Sinai. Some of these echoes are 
obvious. The law was given to Israel about seven weeks after 
the Passover; the Spirit is given to the church about seven weeks 
after the cross. The anointed leader has gone up, and the divine 
presence comes down. There are tangible physical signs: a great 
noise from heaven, whether thunder and trumpets or a mighty 
rushing wind, and the descent of God in fire. The gift that defines God’s people—first the law and then the Spirit—is given. 
The people are commissioned as kings and priests, and the tabernacle/temple is established. A sermon is preached, calling for 
obedience. A new covenant has started.
Then there are subtler echoes, which indicate that Pentecost is in some ways the reversal of Sinai, as well as of Babel. 
Sinai was a moment of national apostasy. Moses came down the 
mountain to find the people embroiled in the most wicked act 
in their short history, worshiping a golden calf and thanking it 
for leading them out of slavery. God condemned them as a stiffnecked generation. Three thousand people were cut down by the 
sword, and died. From that time on, the promise of priesthood 
was limited to the Levites, who responded to the Lord’s call.
Pentecost, on the other hand, is a moment of national blessing. Peter confronts the people after the most wicked act in their 
history, the crucifixion of their Messiah. Yet his confrontation 
is shot through with mercy. He promises forgiveness and the 
gift of the Holy Spirit. Instead of condemning them as a wicked 
generation, he offers them the chance to save themselves from a 
wicked generation. Three thousand people are cut to the heart 
by the word, and saved. From that time on, the promise is for 
all God’s people, who respond to his call.
When you press in to take hold of your inheritance, however, you face opposition. Both Israel and the early church, as 
Sinai and Pentecost
139
they begin to obey their God-given commission to “go into all 
the land/earth, for I am with you,” have to face enemies from 
outside. This is to be expected: the powers-that-be are not impressed to hear that their time is up. But in both cases, these 
external enemies are not the real problem. The Sanhedrin is no 
more able to stop Peter and John than the Amalekites or the Canaanites were able to stop Joshua and Caleb; swords and spears, 
beatings and prison sentences, are no match for the prayers of 
God’s people. The real problem comes from within. It comes 
from sexual immorality, pride, idol worship, injustice.
So it is tragic, if predictable, to read that just as the victories 
of Israel were marred by the greed of Achan, so the progress 
of the church was marred by the greed of Ananias and Sapphira (Josh. 7:1–26; Acts 5:1–10). Achan’s greed is simple theft 
whereas Ananias and Sapphira’s is exaggeration, but the root 
problem is the same. Joshua and Peter, respectively, express 
amazement that people could sin in such ways, given all the 
blessings they have received. And then comes the shocking bit: 
both families are singled out by the Lord, rebuked, and publicly 
killed, to cleanse the people and cause them to fear. As hard 
as we may find these stories to read, they point to the reality 
that, as Jesus explained, it is the inside rather than the outside 
of the cup that makes it unclean. More people die of infectious 
diseases than in warfare. More churches are undone by sin than 
by persecution. If God sees fit to use the ultimate sanction in 
response—and we should notice that God strikes Ananias and 
Sapphira directly, rather than telling the church to do it—it simply shows us the terrible severity of unrepentant sin.
Despite this, the Word of the Lord continues to grow and 
increase, just as Israel had in Egypt. And frequently, key breakthroughs come in exodus-shaped ways. After the Sadducees 
throw the apostles in prison, “during the night an angel of the 
Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out” (Acts 
5:19). An argument about food is followed by new layers of 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
140
delegated leadership. The sermons of Stephen (in Jerusalem) 
and Paul (in Pisidian Antioch) are chock-full of references to 
the exodus. Philip liberates a city with miracles, confronts the 
magician who was bamboozling the people, and then overtakes 
a chariot-riding African in the wilderness and immerses him in 
the waters. In this he imitates not only Moses, but also Elijah 
(1 Kings 18). Saul starts off as a Pharaoh-like figure, oppressing 
and persecuting the people of God, but is commissioned into 
a new Moses: he sees God’s glory, and then is called twice by 
name (“Saul, Saul,” echoing “Moses, Moses”), called to prevent 
the oppression of God’s people, and sent before rulers to bring 
them into their inheritance. There are three stories of Moses seeing the glory of God in Exodus; this may explain why there are 
three stories of Paul seeing the glory of God in Acts (Ex. 3:1–6; 
24:9–18; 33:12–34:9; Acts 9:1–9; 22:6–11; 26:12–18). It may 
even be why we are told that Paul was a maker of tents.
Missionary progress in the second half of Acts is a continued exodus cycle. Believers are forever leaving cities—often 
where they have been suffering—before venturing off into foreign lands, flourishing and succeeding, incorporating Gentiles 
in their number, and returning in triumph. More specifically we 
have Peter, who was going to be killed at Passover by the wicked 
king, waking up at nighttime, being told by the angel of the Lord 
to get dressed and put on his sandals, escaping captivity, and 
passing through a gate that opens for him “of its own accord” 
(Acts 12:10). This causes pandemonium among the soldiers, 
and soon afterward the wicked king is struck down by an angel. 
And in the final chapters, as Paul approaches Rome, we have 
yet another echo of the exodus: Paul escapes from the chains of 
captivity, goes on a journey for which we have an unusual level 
of geographical detail, and plunges into the sea, before emerging 
vindicated on the far side, revealing the healing power of God, 
and continuing toward his final destination.
The twist in the tale is that the final destination, to which the 
Sinai and Pentecost
141
whole story of Acts has been pointing, is not Israel but Rome. 
This has been Paul’s focus all along; he has been as committed to 
reaching Rome, come what may, as Israel was to getting into the 
Promised Land. This tells us a lot. It tells us that, for Luke, the 
bringing of the Gentiles into God’s chosen people is no longer an 
interesting detail on the fringes of the exodus story, but the entire 
point of that story. It also tells us that, for Paul, even the dramatic 
events of his own lifetime have not exhausted God’s redemption. 
He will not be satisfied until the exodus has gone global.

Paul’s Gospel
Romans–Jude
Evangelicals love summarizing the gospel. It is hardly surprising; we are evangel-icals, “gospel people,” after all. We summarize it with illustrations: here’s you, here’s God, here’s a chasm 
separating us, and here’s how Jesus bridges it. We summarize 
it with parables, some of them biblical (the prodigal son) and 
some of them horribly unbiblical (but let’s not go there). We 
identify organizing themes: the kingdom, substitution, personal 
relationship, wrath, heaven. Some of us use creeds. Some of us 
use spiritual laws: God loves me, I have sinned, Jesus died for 
me, I need to decide. We summarize it with songs and stories, 
sinners’ prayers and leading questions, personal testimonies, and 
alphabet soup.
One summary we hardly ever use, but which appears in 
Paul’s writings all the time—even when he is primarily talking 
about something else—goes something like this: We were slaves. 
Paul’s Gospel
143
We were slaves to sin, death, fear, the flesh, and the Devil. But at 
just the right time, God rescued us. He defeated our enemy and 
redeemed us through the blood of his Son, taking us through the 
waters of baptism, uniting us to himself, giving us his Spirit to 
lead us and guide us, and providing us with all we need. He did 
all this, not so that we could do our own thing, but so that we 
could do his thing. And he is taking us on toward a new creation 
of resurrection and victory, milk and honey.
In other words: Paul’s gospel is an exodus.
We see it in Galatians. We were God’s children, but we were 
also enslaved, waiting for the time God had set. When that time 
came, God sent forth his Son to redeem those who were under 
the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons and daughters. 
And because we are sons and daughters, God has sent the Spirit 
of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!” (Gal. 4:6). 
As a result, we are no longer slaves, but children, and destined 
for an inheritance. So don’t turn back and submit to slavery! 
Keep in step with God’s Spirit, and you’ll inherit the promises 
and find fruit in abundance: not just clusters of grapes, but love, 
joy, peace, and the rest (Gal. 4:1–6; 5:1, 16–24).
We see it in 1 Corinthians. Christ is our Passover Lamb, sacrificed to redeem us, and he calls us to be an unleavened people. 
Through him we have become temples where God lives by his 
Spirit. But bear this in mind: our fathers were all baptized into 
Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate spiritual food 
(manna/bread), and they all drank spiritual drink (water/wine). 
Even the Rock they drank from was Jesus Christ. Yet they still 
blew it in the wilderness. They worshiped idols, and fell into 
sexual immorality, and tested God, and grumbled, and eventually God destroyed lots of them. “Now these things happened to 
them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come” (1 Cor. 10:11; see 
3:16–17; 5:6–8; 10:1–13).
It is there in 2 Corinthians. Moses carved letters on tablets 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
144
of stone; we have the Spirit written on tablets of human hearts. 
Moses’s old covenant ministry brought condemnation and was 
temporary; our new covenant ministry brings glory and lasts 
forever. He covered his face with a veil, to ensure the divine 
glory could not be seen by everybody; Jesus removes the veil, 
to ensure that it can. For now, we host God’s Spirit in a tent, 
as Moses did; one day, we will be given a house. So come out 
and separate yourselves from the land of idols (2 Cor. 3:1–18; 
5:1–10; 6:14–18)!
Most emphatically, it is there in Romans. We were all enslaved to sin, bound by the law, and under the rule of death. 
But God redeemed us through Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:21–26). We 
were buried with him in baptism, with our old slave master dead 
in the waters behind us (6:1–14). We immediately found joy in 
serving our new master (6:15–23), experiencing both freedom 
from the law (7:1–25) and new life in the Spirit (8:1–11). For 
now, we continue living as children and heirs, with God’s Spirit 
among us, rather than slipping back into slavery (8:12–17)—but 
we look forward to the new Land of Promise, in which not only 
our bodies but creation itself will be set free from slavery to corruption and liberated into the freedom that God’s children were 
always supposed to inherit (8:18–25). With that future in mind, 
we wait with patience, secure in the love God has demonstrated 
to us in Christ (8:26–39).1
It is worth spelling this out for a couple of reasons. Partly, 
it may be reassuring to hear that we have not just been blowing smoke in this book. The echoes of the exodus that we have 
heard throughout Scripture were also heard by Paul, in rich surround sound, and they provide a crucial narrative context for his 
gospel. Debate often swirls as to which “model” or “image” of 
the atonement is most central to Paul—reconciliation, justification, victory, penal substitution, and so on—but when it is laid 
out like this, it is difficult to avoid concluding that the language 
of redemption, understood through the story of Passover and 
Paul’s Gospel
145
exodus, is at least as important as the others. Given that both of 
the sacraments echo this story as well, with the Lord’s Supper a 
reenactment of Passover and baptism of the parting of the Red 
Sea, we could even say: perhaps more so.2
Yet Paul’s exodus-shaped gospel also presents a challenge 
to us, which comes through clearly in all four of these epistles. 
God has set us free from slavery, Paul explains, not so that we 
might serve nobody at all—which, in the end, amounts to serving ourselves—but so that we might serve God. Time and again, 
in these texts and elsewhere, Paul uses the exodus story not just 
to remind Christians of our liberty, but also of our responsibility. “Stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of 
slavery.” “Flee from idolatry.” “Do not be unequally yoked with 
unbelievers.” “How can we who died to sin still live in it?” And 
so on (Gal. 5:1; 1 Cor. 10:14; 2 Cor. 6:14; Rom. 6:2).
Other apostles use the exodus story in a similar way: as 
a way of encouraging and warning Christians that they must 
continue in faith. Jude reminds his readers that although Jesus 
saved a people from Egypt—and we should note, in passing, 
the matter-of-fact way in which he says Jesus did this (Jude 5)—
he afterward destroyed those who did not believe.3
 Hebrews 
points out that although Israel left Egypt under Moses, many 
of them hardened their hearts into unbelief and rebellion; if we 
don’t want to face the same judgment they did, we need to press 
on in faith until we “enter into rest,” even if it costs us imprisonment, ostracism, and shame (Hebrews 4). So yes, the exodus is 
a beautiful picture of what God has done. But it is also a challenging picture of what we are to do.
This exposes something that seems obscure in the book of 
Exodus, but is actually at the heart of Christian discipleship: 
Israel was set free from serving one master in order that they 
might serve a new one. God’s purpose for the plagues and the 
confrontations, the water-crossings and the fire, was not that 
Israel might be free to wander off and do their own thing, 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
146
but that they might “serve” him (Ex. 7:16; 8:1, 20; 9:1, 13; 
10:3). The contrast in Exodus, in fact, is less between slavery 
and freedom, as we might expect, and more between slavery 
to Pharaoh (which, although we may not have noticed it, also 
characterizes the Egyptians!) and service to the Lord.4 It is as 
if, within the context of the exodus story, service to nobody is 
not an option.
Israel cannot cope without serving someone, and neither can 
we. When a football team buys a new player, they do not set 
him free from one master so he can play the game on his own 
somewhere. They set him free from one master so that he can 
play for another; players simply cannot function without a team 
to serve. And human beings, as worshipers, are just the same. 
We are made to worship, and will find a new master even if it 
kills us. This is one of the tragedies of the golden calf incident: 
no sooner has Israel stopped serving one false god (Pharaoh) 
that they want to start serving another (an idol). David Foster 
Wallace famously put it like this:
In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no 
such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is 
what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing 
some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it 
J. C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother-goddess 
or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical 
principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship 
will eat you alive.5
That’s what the exodus generation found out. It’s what Hebrews and Jude warned local churches about. It’s what Joshua 
meant when he urged Israel to “choose this day whom you will 
serve,” because he knew they would end up serving somebody, 
and it was just a question of whom (Josh. 24:15). Paul is even 
blunter in Romans 6: we are all slaves. Either we serve sin, lead-
Paul’s Gospel
147
ing to death, or we serve obedience, leading to righteousness. 
Those who serve Pharaoh become beasts and perish. Those who 
serve the Lord become priests and flourish.
Four and a half centuries ago, a group of theologians gathered in Heidelberg, Germany, to explain their Reformation 
theology in a question-and-answer format. The first question they asked was this: “What is my only comfort in life 
and in death?” They answered with one of the most beautiful 
paragraphs in the history of Christian theology, with Paul’s 
exodus-shaped vision of the gospel (“paid for,” “set free from 
tyranny”) sandwiched in between two statements of the exchange of masters that we have been looking at in this chapter. 
What is my only hope?
That I am not my own, but belong—body and soul, in life 
and in death—to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ. He has 
fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood, and has 
set me free from the tyranny of the devil. He also watches 
over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head 
without the will of my Father in heaven; in fact, all things 
must work together for my salvation. Because I belong to 
him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, assures me of eternal life and 
makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on 
to live for him.6
Paid for, set free, watched over, assured. But not only that: owned.

The Exodus of Everything
Revelation
Every exodus in Scripture is incomplete, except the last one. 
The patriarchs leave the land and come back wealthy, but 
their descendants are enslaved. Moses leads the people out of 
Egypt, but they die in the wilderness. Joshua takes them into 
the Land, but the Canaanites remain. David and Solomon secure the Land and build the temple, but Israel divides. Exile is 
followed by return, but idolatry continues. Jesus goes into the 
depths and emerges victorious, but leaves when the conquest 
of the Land has hardly started. The church marches out in 
the power of the Spirit, but as the Epistles clearly show, the 
church is still in the wilderness, awaiting its final rest, looking 
to the day when “death of death, and hell’s destruction, land 
me safe on Canaan’s side.”1
 Every time we think the melody is 
complete, there is a further complication, another discordant 
note. Exodus, but. Exodus, but.
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance
150
Until Revelation. Finally, at the last exodus, the chord resolves. Creation itself, led by the victorious children of God, 
steps out of slavery into the glorious liberty it was always intended for, free at last and joyful forever. There are no more 
wars to fight or idols to dethrone. There is no remaining Achan 
or Pharaoh, no further Jericho or Ai. The commander of the 
Lord’s army is here, the dragon has been hurled into the deep, 
and the wicked city has fallen. Now there is nothing but clusters 
of grapes and hills lined with fig trees, milk and honey, justice 
and joy, springs of water, and rivers of wine.
The whole book of Revelation has an exodus shape to it. 
It begins, like the story of Moses, with awe-inspiring visions 
of God (chaps. 1, 4) alongside promises of the rescue that will 
come at the end of the church’s sufferings (2–3). This rescue 
comes through a slain Lamb, like the Passover lamb, who appears in response to the cries of God’s people, ransoms them, 
and makes them kings and priests (5). The people of Israel are 
sealed, so that they cannot be destroyed by the judgments coming on the world (7); those “coming out of the great tribulation” 
(like Egypt; Rev. 7:14) include people from every tribe and nation (like Israel), and they are guided by a shepherd (like Moses) 
to streams of living water and to serve God in his temple (like 
the exodus).
The throne of God, like Mount Sinai, is accompanied by 
thunder, lightning, earthquakes, smoke, and trumpets (Revelation 8). Two witnesses, like Moses and Aaron, are sent by God 
to prophesy, and they are opposed by the evil ruler and his 
magic-working false prophet (11; 13). Plagues are sent from 
heaven, including water turning to blood, frogs, boils, heavy 
hailstones, locusts, and darkness (9–16).2
 As the cosmic battle 
builds, a dragon figure (like Pharaoh) tries to kill the male child 
of a woman (like Moses) and sweep her away in a river (as 
at the Red Sea), but she is carried away on eagle’s wings into 
the wilderness, and the dragon is hurled down and conquered

by the blood of the Lamb (12). Their victory accomplished, 
God’s people “sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and 
the song of the Lamb” (Rev. 15:3), and we see the tabernacle 
opened (15). Finally, as in Joshua, we have the conquest of the 
land: after the blasts of seven trumpets, we see the collapse of 
the wicked city where the prostitute lives (17–18), the defeat 
of the enemy by the commander of the Lord’s army (19–20), 
and the establishment of a new land, a new city, and a new 
temple (21–22).
It is the perfect way for the Scriptures to conclude. This is 
not just because it resolves the plot, enabling us to say with 
complete confidence that “they all lived happily ever after.” It 
is also because, by ending with the exodus of everything, this 
kind of conclusion reveals to us what type of story we have 
been reading all along. The Bible is a redemption story. It is a 
cosmic exodus, stretching from Eden to the New Jerusalem. 
All the exodus narratives we have seen in this book—political, 
geographical, spiritual, liturgical—are contained within a global 
one that only comes to completion at the return of Christ. So if, 
at times, it has seemed like we are going round in circles, making bricks without straw, trapped in slavery to sin and death for 
century upon painful century, and crying out for someone to 
help us, that is because we have been. When Adam sinned, we 
left our homeland, fell into captivity, and have been hoping to 
get back ever since.
So have the oceans. So have the forests. Paul’s teaching in 
Romans 8 is remarkable here: it is not just human beings who 
are awaiting redemption, but “creation itself will be set free 
from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the 
glory of the children of God” (v. 21). We are looking forward 
to the exodus of everything. When we left Eden and headed into 
Egypt, we took the cedars and the swordfish and the puffins with 
us. The physical world, over which we were given dominion, 
suffered the consequences of exile and ruptured shalom. Like 
Fourth Movement: The Great Deliverance

a woman in labor, creation as a whole is crying out in anguish, 
straining toward the day when her labor pains will be over and 
the new creation will break out from inside the old.
And when our true and better Joshua returns to lead us 
across the Jordan, creation will come too. We will rise up from 
the riverbed followed by a multicolored menagerie of flora and 
fauna, like a latter-day Noah emerging from the depths and 
blinking at the brightness, to find that the waters have receded 
and there is no longer any sea. There is a new heaven and a new 
earth, not just a new Jerusalem. The labor pains were worth it. 
Paul was right: the weight of glory makes our light and momentary afflictions seem trivial. Tolkien was right: everything sad 
has become untrue.3
 Lewis was right: the dream has ended, and 
this is the morning.4
 Dostoevsky was right:
In the world’s finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, 
something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice 
for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the 
atonement of all the crimes of humanity, for all the blood 
that they’ve shed; that it will make it not only possible to 
forgive but to justify all that has happened.5
Death has been swallowed up in victory. The enemy who 
once harassed us and threatened us has been obliterated, and 
his entire army with him, and the whole world looks different. 
High-rises have become orchards. Children are no longer hiding indoors for fear of neighbors or potential predators, but are 
chasing and laughing and playing in the streets. The desert is 
in bloom. The mountains and the hills have broken forth into 
singing. The trees of the fields are clapping their hands. Death 
is no more, and neither is there any mourning, or crying, or 
pain, for the former things have passed away. Further up, and 
further in!6
“He who testifies to these things says, ‘Surely I am coming 
soon.’ Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!” (Rev. 22:20).

Review Questions
1. How does the general story line of Revelation recall the exodus 
story?
2. How does Revelation extend the scope of Exodus?
3. What is the character of the new Promised Land?
Thought Questions
1. How might the story of Joshua, Rahab, and the defeat of Jericho 
shed light on the destruction of the city in Revelation and the 
relationship between it and the bride?
2. How does the conclusion of Revelation return us to Eden? How 
do exodus and Eden themes relate?
3. How is the glorious Mount Zion of Revelation like Mount 
Sinai? How is it different?

Coda
Living the Exodus
The task of the church can be described in all sorts of ways, but 
one of my favorites is this: we are called to make the echoes of 
the exodus louder. We have been given the responsibility and 
the privilege of standing in the middle of this epic story and 
witnessing to it. People all around us, going about their daily 
business, do not recognize the Pharaohs and the plagues, the 
manna from heaven and the chariots in the deep. Part of the task 
of the church is to amplify the music of redemption, so that they 
(and we) might hear it for what it truly is.
The most obvious way we do that is by celebrating the sacraments. Consider: Jesus gave two sacraments to his church, and 
they both enact the exodus. In baptism, we celebrate the burial 
of the old, the passing from death into life, and the drowning 
of our enemies in floodwaters. In the Eucharist, we remember 
how God ransomed us from slavery to sin and death through 
the blood of a Lamb, uniting us both to him and to one another. 
Whenever we baptize someone or share in the Lord’s Supper, 
we are witnessing to ourselves, and to the world around us, 
that all of us have known slavery. All of us live in hope of a 
Coda
156
land flowing with milk and honey. And Israel’s God has stepped 
down to liberate us from the former, and take us triumphantly 
into the latter.
We are saying more than that, too. In baptism we declare not 
only our liberation from the Pharaoh of sin, but we declare our 
new identity as a kingdom of priests to God. In baptism we are 
baptized into the promised Prophet who is greater than Moses. 
In baptism we are manifested as those joined to the multitude 
of a new people, born again through divine deliverance; we are 
seen as led by the pillar of the Spirit, into the new creation. In 
baptism, we are washed in the same waters that were divided 
in the second and third days of creation, brought through the 
waters of the flood, carried through the trial of the ford of the 
Jabbok, and taken up from the Red Sea. In baptism, our bodies are marked out for resurrection, for entrance into the new 
creation. We walk in the same path as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, 
Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Israel, Ruth, Hannah, Samuel, David, 
Solomon, Elijah and Elisha, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Esther, 
Ezra, and Nehemiah. We walk in the path of Jesus Christ: the 
way of exodus.
Similar things are true of the Lord’s Supper. Every time we 
celebrate it, we are drawn back to the Last Supper—to that 
night—and, beyond that, to all of the many exoduses and passovers that preceded it. Not for nothing did Jesus tell us, “Do 
this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me” (1 Cor. 
11:25). Yet we are also drawn forward to that which we await 
in the future: the great marriage supper, for which the bread and 
wine are the entrée. “I will not drink again of the fruit of this 
vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s 
kingdom” (Matt. 26:29). Or, as Paul put it, “As often as you 
eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death 
until he comes” (1 Cor. 11:26).
As we share in the sacraments, our bodies are caught up in 
the rhythm of redemption, echoing our past deliverance but also 
Coda
157
anticipating our future one. The music we have been listening 
to in this book, in other words, is not just something we hear
but also something we participate in as we share the Lord’s 
Supper and baptize one another. The music moves our souls 
and animates our bodies. We become part of it, and it becomes 
part of us. We enter into the biblical symphony because it is 
ours, not just theirs. As we tear the loaf and share the cup, we 
are Joshua and Caleb, remembering the Passover meal, but we 
are also tasting the grapes of Eshcol and reveling in the wine to 
come. As we pass through the waters of baptism, we join with 
Moses and Miriam on the far shore of the sea, singing both of 
what God has done and of what he will do, knowing that the 
God who held back the waters of the Red Sea will make short 
work of the Jordan.
This symbolic performance of the exodus, transposed into a 
Christian key, is then filled out and amplified by the rest of our 
weekly worship. We sing songs of redemption and rescue. We 
pray to the God who hears our cries for deliverance and thank 
him for his mighty acts. We read and study the story of God’s 
people. We bring financial offerings for God’s house. We are 
sent out, in the power of the Spirit, in the knowledge that the 
journey is not yet over.
We live daily life in the wilderness. We rely on God’s provision for our water, our clothing, and our daily bread. We follow the cloud of God’s presence wherever it goes. We live not 
by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth 
of God (Matt. 4:4). We renounce the worship of idols and all 
that goes with it: sexual immorality, injustice, greed, drunkenness, rebellion, grumbling, and unbelief. We preach the gospel 
of redemption to those around us. When we face opposition, 
whether from enemies of God’s people (Amalek), religious charlatans (Balaam), temptations to sin (Moab), or our own flesh, 
we stand firm. When we encounter those who do not know the 
Lord, we invite them as Moses invited Hobab: “Come with us, 
Coda
158
and we will do good to you, for the Lord has promised good 
to Israel” (Num. 10:29).
We also live as those who have recently been released from 
centuries of oppression: that is, with a preferential option for 
the poor, and a commitment to champion the cause of those 
who have been abused, bullied, captured, disenfranchised, 
enslaved, forgotten, ghettoized, hated, ignored, judged, killed, 
lynched, marginalized, and so on throughout the alphabet. 
Exodus people know what it is to be ground into the dust 
by those with power. So whenever we see it happening to 
others—racial minorities, slaves, trafficked women, the poor, 
unborn children, refugees, the homeless, those with disabilities, sojourners, orphans, widows—we act. We march. We 
speak. We pray. We invite. We give. We use our power to serve 
the interests of those without it, because the exodus was never 
just for us. Free people free people.
And of course, we tell this story. We tell it to our children, 
and we write it on our doorposts. The God of the exodus is the 
unchanging “I am”; he was there for us in Goshen and Ararat 
and Babylon and Jerusalem, and he will always be there for us 
in the future. He brings us out and he brings us in, and when 
we come back, we always find ourselves with more than we 
started with. One day the Jordan will divide, and the trumpets 
will sound, and worldly powers will collapse, and the vines will 
stretch as far as the eye can see. But in the meantime, as we look 
forward to that and look back to our deliverance from Egypt, 
we have a song to sing:
I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;
the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
The Lord is my strength and my song,
and he has become my salvation;
this is my God, and I will praise him,
my father’s God, and I will exalt him. (Ex 15:1–2)
